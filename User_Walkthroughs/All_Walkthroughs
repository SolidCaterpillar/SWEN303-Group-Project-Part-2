# All Walkthroughs

Here, is the aggregated data that we collected from our note-taking as user's did their walkthrough of the application.

### Task 1:

1. **Problem**: Expense creation broke the first time. Create button did not work.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

    Felt like more of a Figma issue. 

2. **Problem**: Expense form was confusing for the user. They wanted to split everything immediately and got lost when they had to split\
**Severity Scale**: 2

    Not immediately clear that there's splitting, and that it is scrollable.\
    The team should look into solutions where there are visual indicators for the user. These include: down arrows, scroll bars etc.

3. **Problem**: Unable to verify the addition of the expense due to unclear location\
**Severity Scale**: 2 (mainly because they double clicked)

    Double clicked, getting past the confirmation dialague. Then got confused.
    Buttom bar alart to allow user's to be linked to the new expense.

4. **Problem**: Found trouble with interacting with the form (Could be a figma issues)\
**Severity Scale**: 1 (same as firt problem)

### Task 2:
5. **Problem**: User initially tried clicking pay card on homepage, only then did they press the pay icon.\
**Frequency**: 2 \
**Severity Scale**: 3

    Makes sense, did not respond well to feedback on the app. 

6. **Problem**: No feedback on homepage or pay-up page after payment confused.\
**Severity Scale**: 2 

    It was not a design choice, but a lack of implementation. Here, we did not put in time to show confirmation for her action.\
    Solutions could include a visual indicator, it dissapearing or a notification box.

7. **Problem**: Colours made it seem like they were uninteractable on the pay up page\
**Severity Scale**: 2

    Nav-bar seemed confusing for them with the blue colour for verification. This created a sense of overcrowding and confusion.

### Task 3:
8. **Problem**: Difficulty in viewing past/future expenses.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

    Confusion if past-week of expenses included todays expenses. If we consider recognition rather than recall, it may be a problem however it wasn't a major cognitive roadblock.\
    Future solutions could be using words, such as "past week" 

9. **Problem**: Confusion in navigating to expenses page.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

    Issue could come about with expenses as an icon and name being confusing.\
    Future decisions would include a change in colour and text/icon.

10. **Problem**: Misinterpretation of expenses summary.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

    Problem with the dashboard, but nothing.

### Task 4:
11. **Problem**: Used the fab at the top and looked at the pie chart for all insights. Did not access the category.\
**Severity Scale**: 3

    Got the job, just not the way intended. Key issue is that there is no indicator that you can break down by indicator.\
    Solution could be an arrow icon or other indicator.

### Task 5:
12. **Problem**: User was confused, expected system to be the default setting for colour.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

    Accessibility options should not take precedence over colour schemes set by an app. especially if you consider things such as branding.

13. **Problem**: High contrast had issues with text. Noticed in the homepage and FAQ.\
**Severity Scale**: 4 

    Major reading issue, especially when is a feature improving accessibility\
    Quick fix, just need to change variable names.

14. **Problem**: User looked for a 'Customizability' button first, then was unsure what to choose between 'App settings' and 'Household settings' before deciding on 'App settings'.\
**Severity Scale**: 2

    Looked for a Customizability settings option. App settings and household settings confused the user\
    Rename catories for more explicit categories, for example "flat management" and "App Settings"

### Task 6:
15. **Problem**: User confused due to a non-functional help and support button in hamburger menu. \
**Frequency: 5** \
**Severity Scale**: 4

    Major issue, should reorganise the app for this.

16. **Problem**: Difficulty in finding support resources.\
**Severity Scale**: 2

    Should not be in settings, mentioned as earlier.

17. **Problem**: Unclear help documentation.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

    Problem with overall structure

18. **Problem**: No guidance for troubleshooting.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

    They didn't like the FAQ content, it is purely cosmteic as it would be covered in fleshed out in a finished app.
