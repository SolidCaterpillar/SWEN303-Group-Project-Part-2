# Identified Problems

We are using the severity rating for a usability problem based on Jakob Nielsen:

0 = I don’t agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before the product can be released

We chose this because we have used it in the previous part of the group project to evaluate our team’s wireframe. We are going to use it to evaluate the different team members on our group’s prototype. We will be using the frequency that people ran into paint points/confusion and factor them into our decision.

I believe that anything is a purely Figma issue should be a 1. We will keep these in mind if they come up in future prototypes, especially ones using different technologies.
