# Identified Problems

We are using the severity rating for a usability problem based on Jakob Nielsen:

0 = I don’t agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before the product can be released

We chose this because we have used it in the previous part of the group project to evaluate our team’s wireframe. We are going to use it to evaluate the different team members on our group’s prototype. We will be using the frequency that people ran into paint points/confusion and factor them into our decision.

I believe that anything is a purely Figma issue should be a 1. We will keep these in mind if they come up in future prototypes, especially ones using different technologies.

## Cognitive

### Task 1:
**Problem**: Expense creation broke the first time. Create button did not work.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

Felt like more of a Figma issue. 

**Problem**: Expense form was confusing for the user. They wanted to split everything immediately and got lost when they had to split\
**Severity Scale**: 2

Not immediately clear that there's splitting, and that it is scrollable.\
The team should look into solutions where there are visual indicators for the user. These include: down arrows, scroll bars etc.

**Problem**: Unable to verify the addition of the expense due to unclear location\
**Severity Scale**: 2 (mainly because they double clicked)

Double clicked, getting past the confirmation dialague. Then got confused.
Buttom bar alart to allow user's to be linked to the new expense.

**Problem**: Found trouble with interacting with the form (Could be a figma issues)\
**Severity Scale**: 1 (same as firt problem)

### Task 2:
**Problem**: User initially tried clicking pay card on homepage, only then did they press the pay icon.\
**Frequency**: 2 
**Severity Scale**: 3

Makes sense, did not respond well to feedback on the app. 

**Problem**: No feedback on homepage or pay-up page after payment confused.\
**Severity Scale**: 2 

It was not a design choice, but a lack of implementation. Here, we did not put in time to show confirmation for her action.\
Solutions could include a visual indicator, it dissapearing or a notification box.

**Problem**: Colours made it seem like they were uninteractable on the pay up page\
**Severity Scale**: 2

Nav-bar seemed confusing for them with the blue colour for verification. This created a sense of overcrowding and confusion.

### Task 3:
**Problem**: Difficulty in viewing past/future expenses.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

Confusion if past-week of expenses included todays expenses. If we consider recognition rather than recall, it may be a problem however it wasn't a major cognitive roadblock.\
Future solutions could be using words, such as "past week" 

**Problem**: Confusion in navigating to expenses page.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

Issue could come about with expenses as an icon and name being confusing.\
Future decisions would include a change in colour and text/icon.

**Problem**: Misinterpretation of expenses summary.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

Problem with the dashboard, but nothing.

### Task 4:
**Problem**: Used the fab at the top and looked at the pie chart for all insights. Did not access the category.\
**Severity Scale**: 3

Got the job, just not the way intended. Key issue is that there is no indicator that you can break down by indicator.\
Solution could be an arrow icon or other indicator.

### Task 5:
**Problem**: User was confused, expected system to be the default setting for colour.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

Accessibility options should not take precedence over colour schemes set by an app. especially if you consider things such as branding.

**Problem**: High contrast had issues with text. Noticed in the homepage and FAQ.\
**Severity Scale**: 4 

Major reading issue, especially when is a feature improving accessibility\
Quick fix, just need to change variable names.

**Problem**: User looked for a 'Customizability' button first, then was unsure what to choose between 'App settings' and 'Household settings' before deciding on 'App settings'.\
**Severity Scale**: 2

Looked for a Customizability settings option. App settings and household settings confused the user\
Rename catories for more explicit categories, for example "flat management" and "App Settings"

### Task 6:
**Problem**: User confused due to a non-functional help and support button in hamburger menu.\ 
**Frequency:**
**Severity Scale**: 4

Major issue, should reorganise the app for this.

**Problem**: Difficulty in finding support resources.\
**Severity Scale**: 2

Should not be in settings, mentioned as earlier.

**Problem**: Unclear help documentation.\
**Severity Scale**: 1

Problem with overall structure

**Problem**: No guidance for troubleshooting.\
**Severity Scale**: 0

They didn't like the FAQ content, it is purely cosmteic as it would be covered in fleshed out in a finished app.

## Focus Group

### What were your first impressions of the app?
**Problem**: The navigation bar was considered too dark, and low contrast between the icons and the background.\
**Severity Scale**: 3

Important Fix

**Problem**: Thought that the overall colour scheme was a bit too "swampy"\n
**Severity Scale**: 2

Cosmetic thing, recurring issue

### Describe your experience as you navigated the app?
**Problem**: The help and support button in the hamburger menu did not function.\
**Severity Scale**: 4

Format issue from earlier

**Problem**: Navigation in the top left in settings, expected to use system back button
**Severity Scale**: 1

Something we would implement in a production prototype, not something figma would do

**Problem**: Considered the "insight" name confusing
**Severity Scale**: 2

Could have a different name, relatively minor and most people understood.

**Problem**: Would want more "insight" stuff on the home page
**Severity Scale**: 0

More graphs, and previews. We wanted more visual stuff.

Other group really liked simple layout, and actually wanted it to be simpler.

### Were there any parts of the app that you found confusing or hard to use?
**Problem**: In dark mode, some text was not visible.\
**Severity Scale**: 4 

As earlier, same score

**Problem**: Pay up was confusing -> incoming and upcoming are in separate places could be in one place
**Severity Scale**: 3

This is in the homepage, upcoming expenses was confusing to users. Shows the need for a tutorial or clear seperation.

**Problem**: The help and support tab was separate in the settings
**Severity Scale**: 4

As earlier

**Problem**: Was confused between household settings and app setting\
**Severity Scale**: 2

As earlier

**Problem**: There was no implementation to manage flatmates or groups, even though there was a button for "Household Settings".\
**Severity Scale**: 2

It was not one of our tested user flows, however, testers said it would be useful

### How did you feel about the colour scheme of the app?
**Problem**: The colours used in the navigation bar and header were not appealing, and participants suggested removing the blue colour.\
**Severity Scale**: 3

Major issue with colours, will require a rework. 

**Problem**: The color was swampy\
**Severity Scale**: 1

It's a feeling cosmetic.

**Problem**: The different tones was good but green overall was not bad -> could be better
**Severity Scale**: 1

Good colour theory, just green is a bad vibe.

**Problem**: blue is too dark(on the add expenses)
**Severity Scale**: 1

No-one had trouble, just looked bad against the green.


### If this were a real app, would you use it? Why or why not?
**Problem**: Lack of intuitive design elements. Lack of consistency overall\
**Severity Scale**: 1

Icons are different from the rest of the design, it created a sense of friction within the design. 

Our team disagees as they serve different functions, profile icons weren't going to be similar to nav-bar.

**Problem**: pay up was unclear, did not know what that meant
**Severity Scale**: 2

The word pay-up is confusing. 

This shows the importance of an onboarding tutorial for the app **SOLVES PROBLEMS**

## Overall Issues

**Problem**: The layout of the payments page was well-received, but users had issues with the colour scheme and navigation functionality.\
**Severity Scale**: ?

Highlights an overall themes with our colours and navigation indicators

**Problem**: The lack of an onboarding process made it difficult for users to discover certain features, like swiping between pages.\
**Severity Scale**: ?

User's had issue with understanding the purpose of key functionalities. This induces a sense of complexity that decreases the positive UX of the app.
