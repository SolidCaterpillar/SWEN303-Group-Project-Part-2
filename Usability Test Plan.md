# Testing Overview
The following test plan describes the objectives of our testing of our working prototype created in Part One of the Project. This involved the creation of a Flat Expenses Management App.

Our key objectives from User testing are to evaluate the following:
•	Handling of **“Core Functionalities”** offered by the working prototype. This includes Creation of expenses, paying relevant users, viewing past/future expenses, managing insights and modifying settings. We will primarily be observing the usability of our app for the test subjects
•	Identify any **bugs** or **pain points** in the design experienced by users.
•	Understand the overall **emotional feeling** as users use our app. As we are handling something as delicate as finances. We want to ensure that users are confident in their decisions to reduce stress on them. (THIS IS OPTIONAL)
•	Collect **general feedback** and **satisfaction** from test subjects.

With these objectives in mind, we will collect and analyse user experience of the app through the use metrics. From these metrics, we will then classify them by severity, giving us and understanding of how will prioritise changes in future iterations.
This study will be primarily focused on the experience of University Students. They will be 6 SWEN303 Students at Victoria University. While it is good that we are doing User testing, this does not cover the needs for all our intended userbase. Future testing must be done for a broader picture on the usability of our application.
