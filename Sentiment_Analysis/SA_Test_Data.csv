1,"So add a new expense and then split it. Yep. Okay, so we'll go to the ad expense button. That's in the bottom Yeah, and it will come up Enter the name. Is this the name for the expense? Yep Is there cheese great? Try to follow the details rent Mm-hmm 1200 The baby is 31st of May repeat weekly 31st of May It's coming up as different values Try to click again, it's not interactable Oh Yeah, it's coming up with cheese and then hello and in Just keep going yeah repeat Did you want to weekly repeat sweet and then split with everybody wasn't it? Oh three three. Yeah, sweet So all of them And then create the expense using the button down here Okay, it's coming up is there wasn't anything there it's a good era Letting me know So we wanted it for rent the immense 1200 okay, it's coming up as 10 and in the repeat was weekly And we want it to be with Sam as well because we want it to be split with three people, let's see what happens a Very funky blue cheese so flat true Okay, I'm assuming that the name Okay, try well maybe I can exit out and yeah, let's try again let's go at expense We're entering the name Cheese still Yeah, and we go ran into the amount is there it's coming up as hello Oh Sure weekly Description Let's try and create it. Okay, it's coming up with an error here. Let's try again Rinse inter amount is 10 select values weekly Okay Creating itself Don't quite know what's up with that. Okay. Okay, we move in next It just wouldn't create an expense it would when the first values were entered It would then give error messages saying some of the values were blank Even though they were filled out and then on filling them out again Clicking the create expense button would just not do something. I wouldn't do anything  ","Okay, so we're paying an expense. I want to go into the pay up section And I will guess pay the click the pay button, okay Open Alex and you select the power the power cool. Yeah, I'm here. I see the Alex categories I see the power I will click pay their pay for power. Yes It is now disappeared from the list and I imagine if I go to home. Yeah","okay payment So there's an expenses tab. This is going into yeah, I can see the history from today The past week and the past month. Okay. Yeah, so you had to locate Garbage garbage and verify the detail who paid the coverage for that. Okay, so garbage was paid in the past week $380, you know, it was paid by person one and person two on the 27th of May. Okay  ","Okay, so we'll go into the insights tab. I can see a very nice pie chart here. Yeah We've got the top categories for rent, which is indeed the top category power is next. Yeah, then it should be broadband Yep, and food and other. Yeah. Yeah, so I want you to Click the event category. The rent category is being clicked. I now have a bar chart with the week. Okay So you had to view the monthly the monthly I now have the bar chart with four values on it It was paid consistently it seems with consistent rent. So they're all the same value. Yep, all 450. Yep. Looks good","Okay, so that will probably be in the three bar menu. I'm thinking we're going in here probably app settings And we wanted to do accessibility Which isn't quite here, but it's probably on the display. Yes And then there's dark mode system and different contrasts so we wanted accessibility So let's say we go colorblind friendly. It does indeed change the colors Okay Yeah, and it stays as you go through that. Yep. I Want you to try other? Accessibility see what you see. Okay, let's go back into Display so there's the dark mode. Yeah, that works nicely. We've got high contrast which does that as well? The system do something. I imagine All works well","Open support ensuring user can find information and contact support if needed perfect That will again probably be in the three bar menu help and supports right there. Good. It's not showing as interactable Try app setting app settings if we go into absent. Yep. Okay. There is a helping sport thing in app settings That could be one thing to just have as a little issue It's in two different places So we'd want to contact support Yeah, and then we'd want to fill out our information Our email the message that we have and then we could send it and it comes up with the confirmation","No, it was all very intuitive yeah, no, it was easy to move around the buttons made sense There was good contrast with the interactable areas I Didn't have to second-guess myself on anything it all made sense to use The only thing that kind of went wrong was just a figma issue which the figma was better I imagine it wouldn't have gone wrong in the first place and it would have worked as it was intended So I didn't really have any negative feedback to give Okay, what about us one any? Yeah expense one the expense stuff made sense But I had coated you know, yeah, that's just the figma thing it'll kind of make sense to use Good functionalities in there you had your history with all the information Yeah, I like the bear with the variety you guys have in there I think the the traversal options you have is good. I like the tabs Did I see that it was part of it was swipeable and some like that Yeah, so you've got some swipe functionality which I think is really cool That like yet you've got good headers you've got all that it's all in there"
2,yeah that should just be that's that should be it actually. so what was your trouble beforehand sorry all right yeah that's yeah it's more of a figma thing I guess .,yep is it removed go perfect,yep and then you want to navigate yes that should be it yeah that's good that's very fairly intuitive,visualization okay yeah that's fairly good ,,yes so you're supposed to navigate the settings right not that yet you are in the right page to try to find information and contact support yeah if you can try to input something,final remarks would be expense
3,"Okay, so I'm clicking add expense, because that's like the standard Google thing. I'm just making this up, right? Read. Category. What did you say it was again? Just any expense. 1,200? There we go, there's our date done. And repeat. Did you say how often? Every week. I'm going to split it with Sam and Alex and me. My description. Whatever it says for me. I'm going to click create. Sweet. And then I'm done. I'm going to go into expenses and look at future expenses. And then, I can't remember what I even set it to. Just verify it's been added, I guess. What was it? 1,200 or something. I assume it would be there. Okay, that's fine.","I assume these are my most recent expenses, so I'll go pay up. Then I'll pay Alex back for his rent. Okay. I'll click pay. What is it? Just the bottom one that works. Pay. Then I'm paying for power. Yep. And then what was the last bit? Just make sure it's been removed. It's been removed? Yep. Well, I'd just look in there. Okay, that's nice.",Go expenses. Yep. Then verify payment history. Just verifying payment. Just looking through. Let's say you want to locate the expense for the garbage from the previous week. Yep. So how would you be doing that? I'd look through. I'd go into the past week section. Then look and open it. There we go. That's all our garbage info. Yeah.,"Okay, so I'm going to go to insights at the bottom. And then there's rent. That's the amount. And then at the top there's what percentage of it it is. And what if you want to go specifically and view the insights for rent itself? Can I just click on it? There we go. That's our week's rent or our month's rent. That's nice. Okay.","I'm going to click up here where I'm going to find, hopefully, settings or something. Yeah. Go in there, then app settings, then display settings. Then display settings. I'm going to change it to dark mode if that works. Okay. You actually coded that, don't you?","I'm going to go to the hamburger bar again. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go help and support. No, I'm going to go app settings. Okay. But we're going to assume that it did just take you there. So I assume that just wasn't coded in. Absolutely. Yeah. Then I'm going to look at the frequently asked questions. And then here's some of my answers. I don't know what I'm looking for, but I found it. That's nice. Or I'm going to contact support and send them an email. How would you send them the email? I'm going to put in my first name, Cassie. That's me. My email and my message. There we go. Sweet. Right. They'll get in contact with me. Right.","I mean, there's a couple of buttons that sort of just don't work. Can you remember which ones they were? Like, like there. Help and support. Yeah. Help and support. That doesn't do anything. Yeah. When you're, or some of the other ones. I've now just forgotten them all. Oh, it's just a little bit funky how like when you're putting in text it just auto fills it, but it's more of a like, like prototype type of thing. Yeah. It just doesn't have that functionality there. Yeah. Which one of the tasks do you think was the most like easiest, easiest to do? Like intuitive to do? Probably adding an expense. Adding expense. It's just right there. And which one of them was more difficult to kind of understand and do? Probably pay up because I could have gone in here. Like I never even went into the screen. I just did it on the home screen, but I'm guessing that the functionality is essentially the same. You can do it if you want. Yeah. I can just click pay and then pay for power. Yeah. So it's sort of the exact same, but in a way it's good that there's multiple ways to do it. That is one of the heuristics. That's nice. And then like, yeah, in this power screen, like only the bottom. Yeah. Only the bottom one actually works. Yeah. Do you have any sort of like visual details or like anything you didn't quite like? Regarding like the appearance or the colors used? The colors are fine. It's good to have like the, what should we call it? Like all the display settings and stuff. Yeah. Damn. I'm surprised you coded those. I only did one of mine. But yeah, so you can change the colors for like accessibility and all that. Yeah. That's nice. Okay. Yeah. So overall thoughts? It's pretty decent. Right. Yeah. Especially for a prototype, like obviously some things would have to be like kind of polished, but like that's sort of not what you're looking for, is it? It's just, it does everything you need to. The only thing that it's obviously missing is, yeah, just like an easy way to add like flatmates and stuff in, but that's more of a like setup type of thing than a day to day thing. Like we're kind of assuming this is already, you've been using it for a while, right? Yeah. That makes sense. Yes. But you've got the setting there, so it's not like it's hard to find or anything. Okay. That makes it nice. Yeah. I don't know. Right."
4,okay click the add exchange button right on the front page yeah it'll be rent so just tap all the fields to fill them out okay there's no type category doesn't matter whatever rent category I guess I'm just splitting with everyone should amount 20 into the date so like repeat was there weekly weekly and split with all flatmates right yeah okay so like your flatmates and create exchange created okay sweet. Confident with that. ,I'm gonna click pay yeah and I got a quick power yeah I believe okay pay for power yes cool all right come again you come that's pretty simple,okay I'll probably go to expenses to find that one yeah and I'll probably go to garbage cool and just tell me the names of the people who did it person one a person to yeah that's pretty easy,I'm gonna see rent I'm assuming it's clickable but yeah I'm not actually sure yep monthly breakdown thanks monthly breakdown up here that's pretty simple,okay I'm probably gonna go up here yeah try find something like settings unless I'm missing a customizability button household settings settings or user profile I'm gonna go app settings cool display settings yeah okay so just play around the display settings and then check your accessibility options as well dark mode and let's see high contrast and color blank frame just for fun yeah,all right I'm in settings as I was before I'm just gonna click frequently ask questions have a look at one speaking up what is the purpose of the expense follow us yep can see it all here ask questions put that away contact support just contact support and enter a form pretty easy Cassie Cassie Cassie has no message oh yeah send yep that'll work cool that's easy,you're confident all this stuff is done yep
5,"Okay, so, is it add expense button at the bottom right, so I'm just going to go with that. I'm just going to add a name, it seems like it's compulsory, so I'm just going to fill out the rest of the things we're all with. I can't type it, but it's, does that fill something in for me, which it works, because I don't want to type anyway. I'm going to select rent, because it said it was rent, and I'll enter an amount. I can't enter an amount? Oh, it gave me an amount, fantastic. That's really expensive. I'm glad my rent isn't that much. Alright, let me add a date. I think it will add one for me again. Yep, it did, fantastic. And I want to make it recurring, so I'm going to select a value, and rent, for that much rent, you should be paying it every month, so I'm going to go monthly, and I want to split it equally with all flatmates, right? So I'll select everybody, me, Alex, and Sam. I'll add a description, I guess I'll let it add it for me, right for the three of us, love it. I'll press the create button at the bottom. I'm just not letting it press it. Okay. It's not letting it press it. Yeah, I believe that might be an issue with the app, so we can just continue from there.","So, you're wanting to pay an amount that you're owing to somebody. Okay. So, I've got my upcoming, so I don't think I'm talking about that. I think I'm going to pay someone who I owe money to, so I'll try pay Alex for rent, not, I'm trying to click on, so I initially tried to click on the user name of the person, it doesn't work, so I've pressed the pay button instead. And now I've got all my list of things I need to pay, which is great. So I'm going to pay rent, and then I'll press the pay button. It's less than big, which is cool. I don't know if I should look for it. Okay, it seems like the app wants me to go with the power one, which is fine. Oh, it's green. It's cute. Pay for power. Yes. I would love to do that. Sweet. It looks like it's been paid. Now, I'm just going to see if I can confirm it. Or if I can leave the screen. That would also be fine. I don't know if I'm allowed to do that. Oh, I'm lost to my inside. That's fun. Can I go home from there? No. Cool. I'm kind of stuck in this domain, I think. Okay, cool. So you've removed the... Oh, there I go. Sweet. So you removed it, and then you were stuck on what screen? Sorry? I was stuck on the pay screen, so this screen. Right. Because I think for this, because the colours are kind of darker, I assumed it was blurred out or in the background, so I didn't realise I could actually still interact with this screen. Okay. That makes sense. I think I would have been looking for a back button or something. Yeah. That makes sense.","So I'm thinking about past expenses. The first thing I look at is an expenses tab. I'm going to go to that. I'm looking at the past week. That probably includes today as well. So there's all these three. Back to expenses? Yeah. Past week, played the garbage. Paid for some food. Paid for some rent. Is there anything else? No. That's all.","Oh, insights. All right. So insights being the bottom here. All right. And I want to look at the rent category. So I'm going to click on rent. See what happens. Oh, I see it. I see today I paid 50. If I press on monthly, I pay 50 every week. Which makes a lot of sense. That's how rent works.","So if I'm thinking about accessibility, I'm always going to go here. I see settings. That's good. Display settings. It probably would be in display settings, I would guess. Oh, yeah. Accessibility. High contrast and colorblind friendly. Let me try high contrast. Nice. Dark mode. I like it. Colorblind friendly. Oh, yeah. So it's all the same color. Or it's the same color scheme. So there's people with color. Cool. Is there anything else? Cool. Just test the light dark mode. Make sure that works. Yeah. Dark mode seems to work. Follow system. Cool. Easy. Cool. And if you just go back to default. That's okay. Just on the display settings. Sorry. Higher. Yeah.","I'm going to go to this menu again. It's kind of always my default if I think about settings and stuff. Help and support's right there. So I'm going to go there. I'm not allowed to click on it. Cool. Okay. If we could continue by just go to app settings. Oh, I see. Okay. Help and support. Okay. So I want to look at frequently asked questions first. The purpose of it. Just that one. That's all good. And then I want to submit a help request. Contact support. And just input there. Do an email. And my deep concern. And I can send it. Nice.","I thought they were pretty good. I'm pretty impressed with what you actually put together and the time we were given. I like the separation of who you have to pay and your upcoming payments. I do think it's a lot for one app to do. I think more often apps would work for either one thing or the other. So I think it could be a little confusing to have so much functionality in one thing. But if you were an experienced user and you figured out how to use it, it would be awesome. Cool. And any big difficulties with any of the tasks? I don't think so. I think probably the main thing would just be with the help thing, not being able to access it there. But I assume if it was a real prototype, that wouldn't be an issue."
6,"Should I click Create? Yes. OK, I can't seem to click on the Create button to go to the next page, I guess. Could you put something in the description for me? Can I type it? I don't think you can. OK, that's broken. Take my breaks. Interesting. OK, I'm scrolling out. Cancel out of here. OK. Do you want to just quickly try and do that again? Sure. Please can. Let's see if it doesn't break. Name, category, let's go rent. $1,200, 31st of March, weekly, three household members. Maybe just try and put a description in there. Oh, OK. I think I was waiting for the description. OK, and just press Create. And interesting, it reset the rent and amount and repeat. No, it is not. Do you want to just add Sam again? Oh, never mind. It's not even reset them. It's jumped to cheese. Oh, I think it's because you made a new expense.  ","Can you verify that that exists? Oh, food? Yeah. Food is $80. Rent is that much. Do you want to try expanding? Yes. Yes, there we go. $80. Perfect. Can you pay that for me? Can you confirm, has it been paid? Should I go back to the home page? If you'd like to. Because I'm not sure what's going on. Fair enough. I still have the power? OK, no worries. Well, I tried to pay the power. And it disappeared from the pay section. Well, it's still here. But when you went to the home page, it was still there. I'm not 100% sure whether it did pay. Could you jump over to the pay section and check for me? Yes. Is it there still? It's the first one, yeah. All right, good to know. Should I click the pay button again? ","First, should I go to expense tab? You say you want to go to the expense tab, OK. And then what do you want to do? The past week. Is that what you said? Yes, last week. Last week. So garbage was 380, flatmate person one and person two. ","Well, I see a pie chart, which clearly describes rent being 70% of my expenses, and it totaling to $1,800 monthly. OK, good to know.","OK, I went to the, when I go to the, oh, what's up here? Clicked on the navigation three bars. Went to app settings, display settings, and assume I can go to the dark mode. Oh, shit, that's pretty cool. OK. And high contrast, oh, wow. That's pretty cool. What does system mean? Is it just like? OK, good to know. Typically, the system, the app, the mobile device is either set to dock or level, so we can try and learn from that. So then shouldn't that be the default one? Yes. That you changed. Oh, the color themes. Just need to read. Yes. Well, I changed to dark mode and to high contrast. All right, and do those work well? Yes, those work well. Visibly changed across the page.","I'm on the frequently asked questions, and I can click on the questions available and quickly read through them. OK. Well, the first one anyways. Tapped out the first. I just changed my whole set up to light mode, just to see if I can, yep. So basically, when I was on the dark mode on high contrast, I couldn't see the name. And now I just click the name, click the email. Yeah, I'm just going to click on the message. I don't know if that types up. OK, it's sent through. Could you just confirm that it's been sent through? Yeah, you just need to smack it a few times. OK, there you go. Take my issues. Yeah. Sent. Oh, message sent. And it also has a clear message saying that I will be able to, like, feed back to you after 24, 48 hours.",
