    As earlier, same score

28. **Problem**: Pay up was confusing -> incoming and upcoming are in separate places could be in one place. \
**Severity Scale**: 3

    This is in the homepage, upcoming expenses was confusing to users. Shows the need for a tutorial or clear seperation.

    As earlier

30. **Problem**: Was confused between household settings and app setting\

    As earlier

**Severity Scale**: 2

    It was not one of our tested user flows, however, testers said it would be useful

### How did you feel about the colour scheme of the app?
32. **Problem**: The colours used in the navigation bar and header were not appealing, and participants suggested removing the blue colour.\
**Severity Scale**: 3

    Major issue with colours, will require a rework. 

33. **Problem**: The color was swampy\
**Severity Scale**: 1

    It's a feeling cosmetic.

34. **Problem**: The different tones was good but green overall was not bad -> could be better. \
**Severity Scale**: 1

    Good colour theory, just green is a bad vibe.

35. **Problem**: The blue is too dark on the add expenses. \
**Severity Scale**: 1

    No-one had trouble, just looked bad against the green.


### If this were a real app, would you use it? Why or why not?
36. **Problem**: Lack of intuitive design elements. Lack of consistency overall\
**Severity Scale**: 1

    Icons are different from the rest of the design, it created a sense of friction within the design. 

    Our team disagees as they serve different functions, profile icons weren't going to be similar to nav-bar.

37. **Problem**: "Pay Up" was unclear, did not know what that meant. \
**Severity Scale**: 2

    The word pay-up is confusing. 

    This shows the importance of an onboarding tutorial for the app, since it solves many of the mentionned problems.

### Overall Issues

38. **Problem**: The layout of the payments page was well-received, but users had issues with the colour scheme and navigation functionality.\
**Severity Scale**: ?

    Highlights an overall themes with our colours and navigation indicators

39. **Problem**: The lack of an onboarding process made it difficult for users to discover certain features, like swiping between pages.\
**Severity Scale**: ?

    Users had issues with understanding the purpose of key functionalities. This induces a sense of complexity that decreases the positive UX of the app.
