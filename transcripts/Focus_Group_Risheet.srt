1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We're all ready?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Yep.

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
Easy.

4
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,500
You guys are all good?

5
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Yep.

6
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Sweet as.

7
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,000
You have more to learn, by the way.

8
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,500
OK, yeah.

9
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
So just wondering, what were your first impressions

10
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
using the app?

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I thought it was really intuitive.

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It wasn't hard to find the different screens

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that we need to navigate to or do the different ones.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,500
I really like the icons that are at the bottom,

15
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
even across the entire page as well,

16
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
telling you what each thing does.

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So it's pretty like, even if you don't read it, it's fine.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
You can still understand what's going on.

19
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
OK, sweet.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think the only really big issue I had with this

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
was the bottom part, the colors used.

22
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
I think that the green at the bottom is a bit too dark,

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
because it doesn't contrast that well with the black.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So it can be a little hard to read the text,

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
especially if you didn't have good vision.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,500
I see.

27
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
So the bottom part kind of had an issue,

28
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
in terms of contrast being a thing.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Yeah.

30
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
If there was a bit of a lighter color,

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
or if it was white on the color instead,

32
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
I think it would have worked better.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,500
OK.

34
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, I guess in that sense, as you mentioned,

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
now the icons I feel like are fine for me.

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's just like the text at the bottom kind of got blended.

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
For me, I'm just looking at it right now,

38
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
because when I did do the testing,

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
I didn't even look at the work.

40
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
But now I'm looking at it, the text blends in.

41
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,000
So yeah, probably like a lighter bit at the bottom.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
OK, a lighter color.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
It kind of gives you a good vibe on how to navigate.

44
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,500
That kind of leads quite nicely into our next question,

46
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
which is kind of describe your experience kind of navigating

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
about these tasks.

48
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Like what are kind of some difficulties you had,

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
all that sort of benefits?

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
One issue that I heard, I'm actually

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
trying to remember what the task was.

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
OK, we had to go to this one, and then help and support.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh yeah, the help and support button doesn't work.

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, I heard that issue.

55
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
OK, so in the menu, help and support

56
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
doesn't direct you to anything?

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Yeah.

58
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah.

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK.

60
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
But everything else is fine.

61
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I guess for me, since I didn't actually

62
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
even click on the help and support,

63
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
because I went to contact support immediately.

64
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,000
So it worked fine for me.

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,500
But yeah, I guess if we could link back

66
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
to this particular page here, it would make more sense

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,500
for a user just having more freedom into the app as well.

68
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,000
OK.

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, another thing within the app as well,

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,500
when it went to dark mode and high contrast,

71
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
you can't see the text.

72
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Yes, yes, yes.

73
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Yeah, like Cassie disappears.

74
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
So you don't know whether it's been typed out.

75
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Yeah, that's a good bug.

76
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, so that's one of the minor issues

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that can be fixed immediately.

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
And also, I forgot to mention this within testing,

79
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,000
but it doesn't stay to the thing.

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,500
So you don't know whether that's right.

81
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
You can kind of, if you read it, you know.

82
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
But if you think about it, like, oh, is that what it is?

83
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Sounds good.

84
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,000
What about other kind of tasks?

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,500
Did you have any trouble navigating things

86
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
besides settings?

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes.

88
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
I know there's a whole button up here to go back.

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,500
But I was looking at buttons down.

90
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,000
For me, when I use my apps, I normally

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
have buttons down here.

92
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I guess it's mainly the user on the other apps as well.

93
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I use TikTok a lot.

94
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
It has all the, yeah, so I was kind of like, oh, OK.

96
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
OK, cool.

97
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
And also, it doesn't really have a home button.

98
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
It goes to user.

99
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You can go back, but I don't know what happened here.

100
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, right.

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OK, cool.

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And no other tasks?

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Yeah, what are the things you liked about the navigation

104
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
that you would say would be kept?

105
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I think the way that information is laid out

106
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
is quite good, especially on the payments.

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,500
I like that it's separate to today, past week, et cetera.

108
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
So it's not just one big block of text,

109
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
because it can be quite overwhelming.

110
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
People don't look through all that.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I think the information is separate as well.

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,500
I like how there's also, for that information,

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,500
if you press down, it comes up here.

114
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
And for a quick, extra information for a user,

115
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
it would be like, OK, I paid this person.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Perfect.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
And I'll go into another tab.

118
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, easy.

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So yeah.

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I also liked how it was similar to past and future

121
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
at the top, more than other expenses.

122
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah.

124
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,000
Cool.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,500
I appreciate that.

126
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
They're all on Discord.

127
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, sorry about that.

128
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
OK, and a bit of a quicker question.

129
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
How do you feel about the color scheme?

130
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
No, I wouldn't choose it.

131
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
OK.

132
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think that the shades of green don't match well.

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
I like the darker greens, but I think

134
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
that the lighter green is a different hue,

135
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
if that makes sense.

136
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
So I think it's too lime.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It doesn't have enough blue in it.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,500
So I would say I like the colors of this.

139
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
It's just the top and the bottom half of it,

140
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
which kind of doesn't go well with the app.

141
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I would say that's fine.

142
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,000
OK, cool.

143
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So if you were to change that, what would you guys

144
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
feel kind of matched?

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
I would take out the blue.

146
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I would take out the navy blue, and I'd make it white.

147
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't think any other color.

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Something like white for the border on,

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
kind of like showing you, hey, you can add more things here.

150
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,000
OK.

151
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Or maybe like having this lighter shades of green

152
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
or something similar to that.

153
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Or I would make this white.

154
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
The dash would almost take white to contrast it.

155
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Or white.

156
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
In fact, swapping the contrast colors, say, with orange,

157
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
would you say would be a better option?

158
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Or maybe something more similar.

159
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
I would say that you come with the orange,

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,500
but I would say it would not go well with this.

161
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
I think contrast, well, it just wouldn't look that.

162
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
When it comes to color schemes, I

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,500
think it's better to be simpler rather than more complex.

164
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
So utilizing white and black and contrast

165
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
more and using the same two colors

166
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
rather than having lots of different shades

167
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
of the same color.

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,500
I would say having one bright color within the app

169
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
for buttons or maybe for something like these

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to show, OK, we have color.

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,500
But having the two main, maybe black and white or black

172
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
and some other color that is focused on the app as well

173
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
could represent you as a company and the app as well.

174
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Cool.

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Appreciate it.

176
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,500
OK.

177
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And final question.

178
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
If it's where we are, would you use it?

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why or why not?

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
What would be some good things and what

181
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
would be some drawbacks using it?

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I actually have a really similar app to this

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that I use with my flatmates.

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I think that this has more functionality

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
for doing different things because it tracks your upcoming

186
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
payments, which would be useful.

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
But the app that I use is definitely a lot simpler,

188
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,000
just because it focuses really on those really simple

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,500
add an expense and pay it with your flatmates.

190
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
So I'd probably stick with that just

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
because that's all that I need it for.

192
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,000
But if I wanted an app that could

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
track my expenses and my budget and stuff,

194
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
then I think this would be useful.

195
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,000
I would use it.

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
It kind of reminds me a little bit.

197
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
So any significant drawbacks to the experience using the app?

198
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
What does it show?

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
For me, not really.

200
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Nothing in particular.

201
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,000
There were the minor issues that we had.

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But other than that, it's pretty good app.

203
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,500
Thank you.

204
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Cool.

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah.

206
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I think that's pretty much it.

207
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Rashid, Amish, nothing else?

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,500
No.

209
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,000
Cool.

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you for your time.

211
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Thank you.

212
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
No worries.

213
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Cool.

214
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So what are all your names?

215
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,500
Rachel.

216
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Rachel.

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Arianna.

218
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Karen.

219
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,000
Cool.

220
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Yeah.
