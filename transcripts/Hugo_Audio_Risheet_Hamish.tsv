0	7000	Yeah, and we can also screen card all the phones to see where they're testing and stuff.
7000	9000	Fuck, that's not a bad idea.
9000	11000	Are you guys just doing it on your laptop?
11000	13000	I don't know, yeah, that was our plan.
13000	15000	I mean, you can just download the Figma app.
15000	18000	Just download the Figma app, as long as you have the flows.
18000	20000	Screen recording's good.
20000	22000	It doesn't really matter too much for usability.
22000	24000	You have to record that.
24000	27000	For the testing, you can see how long it takes for each one.
27000	29000	I suppose you can record on the laptop as well.
29000	32000	Yeah, I'm not using my laptop, I'm using my phone.
32000	34000	Oh, yeah, you can use that.
34000	37000	So, officially we're going to start now.
37000	41000	So, welcome to this testing, I guess.
41000	46000	We're going to be testing our prototype, which is for a Flatmates Expense app.
46000	47000	Really?
47000	48000	Yeah, it is.
48000	52000	So, just go through the app.
52000	57000	I'm going to be giving you some tasks which you have to go through and try and complete them.
57000	62000	Make sure you say what you're thinking and just go through your step, take your time.
62000	67000	But just make sure you can tell me what you're thinking about in each step.
67000	73000	Right, so I'm assuming you filled the consent form earlier, so that's all good.
73000	82000	And we will be recording the voice and also your inputs, I guess, for this test for future use.
82000	87000	But we will be leaving the data after the assignment is done, so that's all that.
87000	90000	So, I'm just going to be setting this up.
90000	95000	It's just going to take a minute.
95000	98000	It's all good, just keep recording.
98000	103000	We're just bashing you.
103000	106000	Okay, okay, that's fine.
106000	111000	Yeah, that's why we are here.
111000	116000	I would go for the seat form.
116000	120000	Yeah, I was confused for a second.
120000	136000	And the screen recording will also record your voice and the things you answer.
136000	140000	It's pretty cool, Figma, because that's how it looks.
140000	145000	Okay, so I'm going to be starting the recording now, and I'm going to hand you the phone.
145000	159000	So, this is the testing we're just going to start, and your first task will be verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense.
159000	164000	So, you'll be adding a new recurring expense and verifying that it has actually been added.
164000	169000	And when adding the recurring expense, you'll be splitting it among household members.
169000	178000	Okay, so I'm clicking add expense, because that's like the standard Google thing.
178000	181000	I'm just making this up, right?
181000	183000	Read.
183000	187000	Category.
187000	189000	What did you say it was again?
189000	196000	Just any expense.
196000	201000	1,200? I don't think any of ours work in that way either.
201000	204000	There we go, there's our date done.
204000	207000	And repeat. Did you say how often?
207000	209000	It doesn't say how often, but just choose your favorite.
209000	214000	Every week. I'm going to split it with Sam and Alex and me.
214000	216000	My description.
216000	219000	Whatever it says for me.
219000	221000	I'm going to click create.
221000	223000	Sweet.
223000	225000	And then I'm done.
225000	232000	I'm going to go into expenses and look at future expenses.
232000	236000	And then, I can't remember what I even set it to.
236000	239000	Just verify it's been added, I guess.
239000	241000	What was it? 1,200 or something.
241000	243000	I assume it would be there.
243000	246000	Okay, that's fine.
246000	253000	That's the first task which is done, so let's just go back to the homepage.
253000	266000	The next task is to ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense and removing it from the list.
266000	277000	Basically, there's going to be an existing expense which you already paid, but you're going to be paying up the expense to another person.
277000	280000	Just making sure it's already been done.
280000	282000	What would you be doing in this case?
283000	288000	I assume these are my most recent expenses, so I'll go pay up.
288000	291000	Then I'll pay Alex back for his rent.
291000	292000	Okay.
292000	294000	I'll click pay.
294000	298000	What is it? Just the bottom one that works. Pay.
298000	300000	Then I'm paying for power.
300000	302000	Yep.
302000	304000	And then what was the last bit?
304000	306000	Just make sure it's been removed.
306000	307000	It's been removed?
307000	308000	Yep.
308000	310000	Well, I'd just look in there.
311000	314000	Okay, that's nice.
314000	318000	Then go back to the homepage.
318000	326000	Your third task is just view the past expenses and verify the payment history.
326000	328000	How would you be doing that?
328000	330000	Go expenses.
330000	332000	Yep.
332000	335000	Then verify payment history.
335000	337000	Just verifying payment.
337000	339000	Just looking through.
340000	345000	Let's say you want to locate the expense for the garbage from the previous week.
345000	346000	Yep.
346000	348000	So how would you be doing that?
348000	351000	I'd look through. I'd go into the past week section.
351000	353000	Then look and open it.
353000	356000	There we go. That's all our garbage info.
357000	358000	Yeah.
358000	360000	Nice. Okay.
360000	363000	Now let's go back to the homepage again.
363000	365000	Going to the fourth task.
365000	371000	The fourth task is just look at the insights feature for the rent category.
371000	375000	Is this still going to keep on recording while that's calling?
375000	378000	I don't know if it's going to keep on recording or not.
380000	382000	Sorry about that.
382000	387000	The fourth task is just looking at the insights for the rent category
387000	394000	and just making sure you can see a visual representation for the rent category.
394000	397000	Okay, so I'm going to go to insights at the bottom.
397000	399000	And then there's rent. That's the amount.
399000	404000	And then at the top there's what percentage of it it is.
404000	410000	And what if you want to go specifically and view the insights for rent itself?
410000	412000	Can I just click on it?
412000	413000	There we go.
413000	417000	That's our week's rent or our month's rent.
418000	421000	That's nice. Okay.
421000	426000	And task five is just test the customizability.
426000	432000	So test display accessibility features.
432000	434000	So how would you be doing that?
434000	438000	I'm going to click up here where I'm going to find, hopefully, settings or something.
438000	439000	Yeah.
439000	445000	Go in there, then app settings, then display settings.
446000	448000	Then display settings.
448000	451000	I'm going to change it to dark mode if that works.
451000	452000	Okay.
452000	454000	You actually coded that, don't you?
454000	458000	So you can look at other features as well in the display settings.
460000	465000	We've got contact, FAQs, managing categories.
465000	468000	I'm not sure what week start day does.
468000	469000	That's fine.
469000	472000	Okay, so let's go back to the homepage again.
473000	474000	Genuine hope, sorry.
474000	476000	Yeah, yeah.
478000	480000	I believe it was light mode.
480000	481000	Yeah.
481000	482000	Right.
482000	489000	So now your sixth task, which I believe it's the last task, it's test the help and support functionalities.
489000	492000	So imagine you require some help with the app.
492000	494000	You want to look for some help within the app.
494000	496000	So what would you be doing in that case?
496000	500000	I'm going to go to the hamburger bar again.
500000	501000	Yeah.
501000	502000	What do you actually call that?
502000	503000	I think it's a hamburger.
503000	504000	Yeah, it is.
504000	505000	It is called a hamburger.
505000	509000	Okay, I'm going to go help and support.
509000	511000	No, I'm going to go app settings.
511000	512000	Okay.
512000	515000	But we're going to assume that it did just take you there.
515000	517000	So I assume that just wasn't coded in.
517000	518000	Absolutely.
518000	519000	Yeah.
519000	523000	Then I'm going to look at the frequently asked questions.
523000	525000	And then here's some of my answers.
525000	527000	I don't know what I'm looking for, but I found it.
527000	528000	That's nice.
528000	531000	Or I'm going to contact support and send them an email.
531000	533000	How would you send them the email?
533000	536000	I'm going to put in my first name, Cassie.
536000	537000	That's me.
537000	539000	My email and my message.
539000	543000	There we go.
543000	544000	Sweet.
544000	545000	Right.
545000	547000	They'll get in contact with me.
547000	548000	Right.
548000	551000	So those were all the six tasks.
551000	553000	I hope you remember how to go back to the homepage.
553000	554000	Yeah.
554000	555000	Yeah.
555000	556000	Okay.
556000	557000	Okay, that's fine.
557000	558000	That's fine.
558000	559000	Yeah.
559000	560000	So how was your experience?
560000	564000	Were there any sort of pain points or points you got confused?
564000	567000	I mean, there's a couple of buttons that sort of just don't work.
567000	570000	Can you remember which ones they were?
570000	571000	Like, like there.
571000	572000	Help and support.
572000	573000	Yeah.
573000	574000	Help and support.
574000	575000	That doesn't do anything.
575000	576000	Yeah.
576000	580000	When you're, or some of the other ones.
580000	582000	I've now just forgotten them all.
582000	586000	Oh, it's just a little bit funky how like when you're putting in text it just auto fills
586000	590000	it, but it's more of a like, like prototype type of thing.
590000	591000	Yeah.
591000	593000	It just doesn't have that functionality there.
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	599000	Which one of the tasks do you think was the most like easiest, easiest to do?
599000	601000	Like intuitive to do?
601000	602000	Probably adding an expense.
602000	603000	Adding expense.
603000	604000	It's just right there.
604000	609000	And which one of them was more difficult to kind of understand and do?
609000	613000	Probably pay up because I could have gone in here.
613000	615000	Like I never even went into the screen.
615000	621000	I just did it on the home screen, but I'm guessing that the functionality is essentially
621000	622000	the same.
622000	623000	You can do it if you want.
623000	624000	Yeah.
624000	626000	I can just click pay and then pay for power.
626000	627000	Yeah.
627000	632000	So it's sort of the exact same, but in a way it's good that there's multiple ways to do
632000	633000	it.
633000	634000	That is one of the heuristics.
634000	635000	That's nice.
635000	638000	And then like, yeah, in this power screen, like only the bottom.
638000	639000	Yeah.
639000	641000	Only the bottom one actually works.
641000	642000	Yeah.
642000	648000	Do you have any sort of like visual details or like anything you didn't quite like?
648000	651000	Regarding like the appearance or the colors used?
651000	653000	The colors are fine.
653000	657000	It's good to have like the, what should we call it?
657000	659000	Like all the display settings and stuff.
659000	660000	Yeah.
660000	661000	Damn.
661000	663000	I'm surprised you coded those.
663000	667000	I only did one of mine.
668000	674000	But yeah, so you can change the colors for like accessibility and all that.
674000	675000	Yeah.
675000	676000	That's nice.
676000	677000	Okay.
677000	678000	Yeah.
678000	680000	So overall thoughts?
680000	682000	It's pretty decent.
682000	683000	Right.
683000	684000	Yeah.
684000	687000	Especially for a prototype, like obviously some things would have to be like kind of
687000	691000	polished, but like that's sort of not what you're looking for, is it?
691000	696000	It's just, it does everything you need to.
697000	705000	The only thing that it's obviously missing is, yeah, just like an easy way to add like
705000	711000	flatmates and stuff in, but that's more of a like setup type of thing than a day to day
711000	712000	thing.
712000	715000	Like we're kind of assuming this is already, you've been using it for a while, right?
715000	716000	Yeah.
716000	717000	That makes sense.
717000	718000	Yes.
718000	722000	But you've got the setting there, so it's not like it's hard to find or anything.
722000	723000	Okay.
723000	725000	That makes it nice.
725000	726000	Yeah.
726000	727000	I don't know.
727000	728000	Right.
728000	729000	Thank you for that.
729000	735000	Thank you for giving us your time and to test our prototype.
735000	736000	Thanks.
736000	739000	Thanks for joining us and hope you have a nice day.
739000	740000	Yeah.
740000	744000	Not like you won't be getting big in five minutes time.
744000	746000	Doing the exact same thing.
746000	748000	That's exactly ten minutes.
