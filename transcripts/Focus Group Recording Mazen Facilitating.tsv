0	8320	Awesome, now if we can just quickly get our names so Ricky, Ricky over there, Mazin, Alvean,
8320	20800	and then Hugo, Paxton, Caillou, okay so question one, what were your first impressions of the
20800	21800	game?
21800	22800	Yeah.
22800	23800	It wasn't very pretty.
23800	24800	It wasn't very pretty?
24800	25800	It didn't like colours.
25800	26800	It didn't like colours.
26800	27800	Sorry.
27800	28800	Okay, that's fair.
28800	29800	It's completely valid feedback.
29800	33800	Alright, so the colours in question, what did you like about them?
33800	35800	Just a bit swampy.
35800	36800	Swampy?
36800	37800	A bit dark.
37800	38800	Okay.
38800	39800	Alright.
39800	47440	I didn't notice the colours as much, I did think that the opening home page, there was
47440	48800	quite a lot going on.
48800	49800	So overcrowded?
49800	56120	Yeah, more so that like there was a lot going on there so that limited the size that everything
56120	61400	could be to try and fit it onto the screen, so I feel like it could have benefited from
61400	65760	maybe prioritising some things, making a few things a little bit bigger, just so it was
65760	71320	kind of more obvious what was there rather than trying to just put all of it on there
71320	76800	kind of limited the way that the things could breathe and be a little bit more isolated.
77800	83320	I probably would have focused on like one, either like your past expenses or like paying
83320	86800	new expenses instead of having them both on that screen.
86800	89280	There's not too much going on.
89280	94880	I did actually, I had a moment of confusion as to what pay up was, I was looking at it
94880	100360	thinking, am I paying there, who's paying here, is this shit that needs to be paid soon
100360	103000	or is this actually I can pay it right here?
103000	104000	Okay, that's good.
104000	105000	Alright.
105200	109400	Did you find that the colour settings were any use of changing how you felt about the
109400	110400	whole swampy feel?
110400	114920	Oh, that was just like accessibility stuff, so yeah, that was fine, that was good, I got
114920	115920	my problems there.
115920	117920	Did you like the alternatives colour scheme more or?
117920	118920	What was it?
118920	119920	The dark mode version?
119920	120920	Yeah, yeah, that was good.
120920	126920	I think the dark mode worked better with the greens and like blues that were on there.
126920	128920	You felt the dark mode looked better with the greens and blues?
128920	134920	I do like a dark mode though, so I might be biased, but yeah, I did like the other alternatives.
135840	136840	Alright, sweet.
136840	137840	Thank you very much.
137840	142840	We'll move on to the next question, assuming no one has any other first impressions of
142840	144840	the app that they want to share?
144840	145840	No.
145840	146840	Awesome.
146840	147840	Second question.
147840	153840	Shoot, I'm pulling on the wrong questions, where did we actually put the actual, I'm
153840	155840	going to pause this for a second.
155840	157840	Yeah, awesome, thank you very much, good for catching that.
158760	168760	As I was saying, the next question is, describe your experience as you navigated the app,
168760	172760	so we're sort of taking a focus on navigation here, how you felt while you were going through,
172760	173760	that kind of thing.
173760	174760	Take a moment to think.
174760	182760	I don't know, I was a bit, it's pretty easy to get through the task, to be honest.
182760	183760	Pretty easy?
184680	188680	I'm just going to beg for forgiveness on Figma being Figma, so just try and take it
188680	191680	on how the design actually should have looked.
191680	196680	I thought the navigation was good with it, I liked the separation that you had into your
196680	199680	tabs at the bottom, I thought that was good.
199680	205680	I thought the way that you implemented the swiping functionality was really cool.
205680	212680	I thought that the splitting you did between the stuff that was in your three bar menu
213600	217600	and the stuff that was found elsewhere along the bottom and on the home screen, I thought
217600	218600	that was intuitive.
218600	222600	When asked to do a task that was like, oh, go into the settings or whatever, I was like,
222600	225600	okay, there's not a settings tab at the bottom, it'll be in the three bar menu.
225600	226600	Yeah, and it was there.
228600	229600	Agreed.
229600	231600	I didn't really realise that swiping even existed.
231600	233600	Oh, could you swipe across?
233600	234600	Yeah.
234600	235600	Oh no, that was sick.
235600	238600	There was one where you could swipe down and the scrolling was good as well.
238600	241600	Something came up and you could swipe it away, I thought that was weird.
242520	246520	I thought the insights tab had a bit of an ambiguous name, it would have been better
246520	249520	to be like analysis or I don't know.
249520	252520	So did that give you any confusion when you were going through?
252520	255520	Well, I didn't really know that it was going to be charts and stuff.
255520	262520	I suppose the icon does say, or does show a chart, but you know, it almost would have
262520	268520	been better to have the insights on the home page instead of so much detail.
268520	271520	Maybe, I don't know.
272440	274440	What was the question again?
274440	278440	The question is about navigation, how did you feel about your experiences while navigating
278440	279440	it?
279440	284000	So the fact that you didn't notice there was swiping is a valid part of the navigation
284000	288440	thing, that is a valid thing to bring up.
298440	300440	Any other comments on navigation?
301360	303360	Navigation is pretty smooth.
303360	304360	I like it.
304360	309360	But just a little confusion on the pay up thing and on the insights being.
309360	316360	I didn't actually ever use the icon that's at the bottom that's for the pay one.
316360	319360	I never used it, I used the pay button that was on the home screen.
319360	322360	You pressed the pay button that was on the home screen rather than the one at the bottom.
322360	326360	I noticed it later when I was going to insights, I was like, does it actually do the same thing?
326360	328360	I wasn't sure.
329280	332280	We'll go on to the next question then.
332280	338280	The next question which is, were there any parts of the app that you found confusing
338280	341280	or hard to use?
341280	343280	Yeah, it was that.
343280	348280	I mean it wasn't confusing but pay up on the front then pay up down the bottom.
348280	352280	Upcoming payments and pay up are two separate things as well.
352280	356280	So upcoming payments and then pay up right below, you felt that was a bit confusing between
356280	357280	those two?
357280	358280	Upcoming payment, why?
359200	360200	Do you need me to slow down?
360200	361200	No.
361200	367200	Is the upcoming payments, are they interactable there or is that purely informative?
367200	369200	Like in your idea for the...
369200	371200	They should be.
371200	372200	Click on the bottom.
372200	374200	Let's just try the arrow.
374200	375200	It'll do something.
375200	378200	The arrow, yes, the arrow will make it expand.
378200	383200	I don't think the individual groceries or like the individual things are.
383200	385200	So you think it would have made sense for the...
386120	390120	When you're showing something that's in like upcoming payments, in my head I go, okay,
390120	392120	that's upcoming, I should deal with it right now.
392120	395120	I should click on it and then pay from it from there.
395120	398120	Rather than having to go to a different area and then click that.
398120	402120	So you think that the upcoming payments, each payment should be clickable and should take
402120	403120	you to that payment?
403120	407120	Yeah, I feel like that would be, and it would even consolidate potentially some of the...
407120	409120	I think it's supposed to work that way.
409120	411120	I don't know if that's just Figma, I can't remember.
411120	414120	It could just be that it wasn't implemented.
415040	419040	Even if it is meant to be done that way, it would have been good to have like some dots
419040	422040	or like a pencil or anything.
422040	426040	A pencil, something that indicates edit or click on it?
426040	427040	Yeah.
427040	428040	Okay, yeah.
428040	429040	All right.
429040	431040	So you think that the editing stuff should...
431040	434040	For the payout, you wouldn't click on it, right?
434040	436040	Like that doesn't...
436040	439040	Doesn't seem to allow clicking right now.
439960	442960	Whether that's supposed to happen or not, I can't remember.
442960	445960	But I'm supposed to go to pay when you do that.
445960	446960	Yeah.
446960	447960	Okay.
447960	448960	So anything else then?
448960	451960	Any other thoughts that you felt were confusing on how to use?
451960	455960	There was one part for me within the three bar menu.
455960	456960	The three bar menu?
456960	457960	Let's bring that up real quick.
457960	458960	Yeah.
458960	459960	There was the help and support tab there.
459960	463960	But then there was also help and support within the app settings.
463960	467960	And my first reaction was to click that, which wasn't implemented.
468880	470880	And then I was like, oh, app settings, help and support.
470880	472880	So it felt like there was potentially two areas
472880	474880	where the help and support was going to be
474880	476880	that weren't going to lead to each other.
476880	477880	Makes sense.
477880	479880	So you felt it was confusing to have a help and support section
479880	482880	in the hamburger menu and also any side of the app settings.
482880	483880	Yeah.
483880	484880	Okay, cool.
484880	485880	That's great feedback.
485880	486880	Anyone else?
486880	488880	Any other aspects that you felt were confusing or hard to use?
488880	493880	When I was doing it over there and I had to get the display settings up.
493880	495880	Remember I didn't know which one to click?
495880	496880	Yeah, that's a good point.
497800	500800	You went with how you weren't sure between household and app settings, yeah?
500800	501800	So I just went to app settings.
501800	503800	What would you say we could do better on that front?
503800	506800	What are these even in household settings?
506800	508800	Oh, is that like the flat household?
508800	509800	Oh, okay.
509800	512800	So something that would have made it clear that the household was in a flat.
512800	513800	Yeah, like manage household.
513800	514800	Yeah, like manage household.
514800	515800	Management or something.
515800	516800	Okay.
516800	521800	Because I don't know what you want to have with your app,
521800	526800	but to me managing what would be in a tab like that
527720	529720	is like managing the members that are in the household
529720	534720	or like the flat payments that you're having in there.
534720	539720	To me that's less of a setting and more of like a thing.
539720	541720	So settings perhaps is what kind of...
541720	546720	Yeah, settings to me is like app functionality,
546720	548720	which I don't quite think is up there.
548720	549720	Awesome.
549720	550720	All right, anything else?
550720	552720	Any other aspects you felt were confusing or hard to use?
552720	554720	Nothing.
554720	555720	Sweet.
556640	557640	Let's move on to the next question.
557640	561640	How did you feel about the color scheme of the app?
561640	564640	It's a swampy answer.
564640	566640	We've had one person talk about the swampy answer.
566640	568640	Anyone have anything else?
568640	571640	We can bring up sort of the color scheme across different pages here.
571640	573640	I don't mind the greens.
573640	575640	We'll just wait for the latte.
575640	576640	So you don't like the greens?
576640	577640	No, I don't mind the greens.
577640	578640	You don't mind the greens?
578640	582640	I don't mind like the way that you have the toning of the greens.
583560	585560	They've got the lighter one, and then they've got the even lighter one,
585560	587560	and then they've got the darker one.
587560	590560	I think the color theory stuff that they've done is good.
590560	591560	Okay.
591560	593560	They could have chosen some other colors.
593560	595560	But I don't dislike this color.
595560	597560	I would use it still.
597560	600560	But I acknowledge that there could be a better one.
600560	603560	Okay, what other colors would you say are better than swampy green?
603560	607560	I reckon it could have been better, but it's making all the icons white.
607560	608560	What's that?
608560	611560	Making all the icons and text on the dark green and white.
612480	614480	Making the icons on the dark green and white.
614480	617480	So right now we're seeing obviously that Payup and the hamburger
617480	620480	and the bottom bar are all in black.
620480	622480	Or blue if that's the kind of selected one.
622480	627480	But you're saying those should be white to better contrast the dark green background?
627480	628480	Yeah.
628480	629480	Okay.
629480	634480	There is also on the homepage, there's the pay button that's on the green.
634480	639480	To me, I don't like the way that the blue interacts with the green there.
640400	643400	I don't like how the blue pay button is on the light green.
643400	644400	That could just be...
644400	646400	Feels too much of a contrast maybe?
646400	648400	I think that blue is just a little bit darker.
648400	649400	Too dark?
649400	650400	Too dark.
650400	652400	Because you've got a nice pastel kind of lightish green.
652400	654400	And you have like a navy heavy blue.
654400	657400	And you've got the darker green for your header and footer.
657400	659400	And then the navy is even darker.
659400	662400	Which to me suggests that it's like...
662400	665400	The things that are in between the header and footer to me
665400	667400	should be lighter than the header and footer.
667400	668400	Gotcha.
669320	670320	Kind of like the borders.
670320	671320	That's very good feedback.
671320	672320	All right.
672320	676320	And then while we're on that subject, we may as well talk about the dark mode equivalent.
676320	680320	So let's jump over to app settings.
680320	683320	Let's go to display settings.
683320	686320	And let's switch it over to dark mode.
686320	691320	So with that in mind, what are you guys thinking for the dark mode settings?
691320	693320	How does that look to you guys?
693320	696320	Thoughts on the color scheme in dark mode?
697240	698240	See, I never went to here.
698240	699240	I never went back.
699240	700240	I can't lie.
702240	706240	That one I think someone might have messed up with using the right variables.
706240	708240	Yeah, it is just a little bit dark.
708240	710240	I don't mind the black background.
710240	717240	And I think it works kind of nicely with the lighter green for the header and footer.
717240	721240	I like that the text is now white and the icons are now white as well.
721240	722240	Yeah.
722240	725240	With the dark mode, this should be like contrast.
726160	727160	Like a lot of contrast.
727160	735160	Yeah, I think it's just the colors for the bubbles and where it says broadband and stuff.
735160	738160	I can't see that it's separated.
738160	743160	I can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than the background.
743160	744160	Yeah.
744160	746160	You can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than this background.
746160	751160	Like the color that is here is very similar to the black that's in the background where
752080	756080	it's kind of hard from the distance that I'm at of not even quite a meter, I can't tell
756080	757080	it apart.
757080	758080	Okay.
758080	759080	All right.
759080	761080	I'm just going to other pages sort of thing.
761080	762080	Yeah.
762080	763080	I think.
763080	764080	Yes, no.
764080	766080	I mean, at least you've got the important information.
766080	768080	The blue button is a bit too much.
768080	769080	It's a little bit.
769080	772080	It definitely pops out as like an interactable button.
772080	773080	Yeah.
773080	774080	But it doesn't look nice with the...
774080	776080	It doesn't quite work with it.
776080	777080	Okay.
777080	781080	So in the payoff, the blue button, the pay buttons for each of these kind of stand out
781080	782080	too much.
782080	783080	They're like a little bit of an eyesore.
783080	784080	Yeah.
784080	786080	It feels a bit disjointed from the other color scheme.
786080	787080	Yeah.
787080	788080	Yeah.
788080	789080	Okay.
789080	790080	And then expenses.
790080	791080	Yeah.
791080	793080	This is also just like...
793080	794080	Oh.
794080	798080	Someone didn't use the right variables, I think.
798080	803080	So in the expenses future section, someone obviously might have made a mistake there.
803080	805080	But all right.
805080	806080	Trumpage.
806080	807080	So yeah.
807080	809080	You can't read those.
809080	810080	You can't read those.
810080	813080	It's the dark text on the dark background as well.
813080	814080	The dark text on the dark background?
814080	815080	The text is white.
815080	816080	I could read it.
816080	818080	So on the home page in dark mode, the upcoming payments.
818080	819080	Yeah.
819080	820080	The dark text on the green.
820080	822080	Like the fact that the actual number for $100.
822080	823080	I can read that.
823080	824080	Perfect.
824080	825080	Yeah.
825080	826080	And I can read upcoming payments.
826080	827080	I just can't read what's below it.
827080	828080	Makes sense.
828080	829080	Because it's black on really dark color.
829080	830080	Is it an accident or is it...
830080	832080	I'm pretty sure it's an accident.
832080	833080	Yeah.
833080	834080	But awesome.
834080	835080	All right.
835080	836080	We'll jump over to app settings.
836080	837080	See, actually this looks good.
837080	838080	This probably looks good.
838080	839080	You like how the app settings look like in dark mode?
839080	840080	It looks great in dark mode.
840080	841080	Yeah.
841080	842080	I do like that.
842080	843080	And then in light mode, do you think it looks all right?
843080	844080	Yeah.
844080	845080	It looks fine to me.
845080	846080	Yeah.
846080	847080	It looks fine in dark mode.
847080	848080	All right.
848080	849080	Sweet.
849080	851080	We'll move on to the next and final question.
851080	854080	If this were a real app, would you use it?
854080	855080	Why or why not?
855080	856080	No.
856080	857080	Probably not.
857080	858080	No.
858080	859080	Probably not.
859080	860080	Nah, dude.
860080	861080	Sorry.
861080	863080	I mean, when you guys come to us, you cannot fucking slay us.
863080	864080	Honestly, we want it.
864080	865080	No.
865080	866080	Listen.
866080	867080	We want you to listen.
867080	868080	Going to the home page?
869080	870080	Dark or light mode?
870080	871080	Light mode.
871080	878080	I think if I was using an app, I would want more visual representation.
878080	885080	You have your Insights tab, which has the pie chart and the graphs and stuff.
885080	890080	I'd want more of a focus on that kind of summative kind of visual.
890080	891080	So you want more insights?
891080	893080	Even if it was more visual, more graphs?
893080	894080	Yeah.
894080	897080	Something that I can see quickly and be like, oh, okay.
897080	899080	Here's my summary.
899080	900080	Here's my thing.
900080	901080	How about bar graphs?
901080	902080	Bar graph?
902080	905080	I thought it was kind of funny with the rent that there was a bar graph because it's just
905080	907080	the same value the whole time.
907080	908080	That's fair.
908080	913080	I think that bar graphs, in terms of weekly representations, I think that's good.
913080	915080	I think food is a better example, I think.
915080	916080	Yeah.
916080	922080	I like that because it's a good way of tracking your history.
923080	928080	If there was some summative feature on the homepage or something.
928080	929080	On the homepage.
929080	932080	Something that I open your app, I see it immediately.
932080	934080	I don't need to go to the Insights tab.
934080	936080	Some sort of indicator.
936080	942080	The same way we have a preview of expenses and a preview of payouts.
942080	948080	The homepage, to me, should have a summary of the app.
948080	953080	It should have, here are your most pressing payments, which you have with the upcoming payments.
953080	956080	Here's what you need to pay.
956080	959080	And then here's a little summary of where you're at monetarily.
959080	963080	So what would you want on the homepage in terms of the insights?
963080	965080	What kind of insight would you want immediately in your face?
965080	970080	Just kind of like the pie chart you have is good.
971080	973080	Here's your little piece.
973080	975080	We cleaned total expenses.
975080	977080	I know, but we created something that I like.
977080	984080	The point to make is that you can use a calendar to just remind yourself when you need to pay bills.
984080	988080	So the app has to have some sort of functionality beyond that.
988080	992080	And if you want to manage your expenses, you want to see all of the money.
992080	993080	Where it's going.
993080	995080	What is being spent on.
995080	1000080	So when you say all of the money, are you referring to all of the money or all of the money related to the flat stuff?
1000080	1002080	All of the flat stuff.
1002080	1005080	How much is being paid to wear each week.
1005080	1007080	Right. We're kind of getting a bit messy now.
1007080	1009080	We're questioning the value of the entire app.
1009080	1012080	That's fair. That's the point of the question.
1012080	1017080	So you wouldn't use this to manage flat expenses with other people?
1017080	1019080	Probably not, dude.
1019080	1022080	I can remember rent stealing on a Tuesday every week.
1022080	1025080	And I do it now with my own flat.
1025080	1029080	But if someone pays for, I don't know, say toiletries or something and they say,
1029080	1031080	Oh yeah, chuck me like $20 for this.
1031080	1034080	You don't want that to be sort of built into the app?
1034080	1036080	Or have an app for it?
1036080	1038080	I mean, yeah, but...
1038080	1040080	Or do you reckon that's just not worth it?
1040080	1043080	You're just like, yeah, sure, they said $20, I'll give them $20, done.
1043080	1046080	Well, I guess the point of that is to cater for that, right?
1047080	1049080	I mean, in my current flat, I'm not doing that.
1049080	1052080	If someone buys toiletries, they say, send me $20, and I do it.
1052080	1055080	But the point of this app is to incorporate that, right?
1055080	1057080	So the idea behind the pay-ups.
1057080	1060080	We're somewhat in the market for an app of this type.
1060080	1063080	Yeah, but go back to the main page.
1063080	1064080	The home page?
1064080	1066080	Yeah, the home page.
1066080	1070080	There's total owing, upcoming payments.
1070080	1073080	It doesn't say who's paid, or it doesn't pay up.
1073080	1077080	In pay-up, we do see the people who have paid certain expenses.
1077080	1080080	Are those the people that have already paid?
1080080	1084080	I thought those were the things you had to pay.
1084080	1088080	Well, the idea is someone has paid for it, and you have to pay them for it.
1088080	1090080	Pay them back for it.
1090080	1096080	Like, say, for example, Alex has paid for rent, and butter, and power.
1096080	1099080	And so now your job is to pay your share of that.
1099080	1101080	So I'd go over here, and I'd say, yep.
1101080	1106080	I'd go to here, and I'd say, I want to pay $80.25 for his power.
1106080	1109080	And I pay for that.
1109080	1110080	Or say that I paid for that.
1110080	1112080	Those are bills that Alex has put up.
1112080	1116080	Those are bills that Alex has paid for already.
1116080	1118080	That you need to pay your share for.
1118080	1121080	It's like if Alex goes and pays the rent, it's like, all right, cool.
1121080	1122080	I just paid $2,000 in rent.
1122080	1125080	You guys can each chuck me $500.
1125080	1129080	To be honest, I'd almost just scrap paying on the home screen.
1129080	1131080	I'd just make it so you could only pay here.
1131080	1135080	So you would not want to see things you need to pay still?
1135080	1137080	No, I'd want to see things.
1137080	1138080	Isn't that up?
1138080	1140080	Isn't that in the upcoming payments?
1140080	1141080	Aren't they almost the same thing?
1141080	1145080	You're saying that upcoming payments and pay up are almost the same thing?
1145080	1146080	I don't know.
1146080	1147080	What's the difference?
1147080	1149080	Wouldn't you like to see what you need to pay?
1149080	1152080	Sorry, let me rephrase.
1152080	1156080	Upcoming payments is meant to represent expenses that nobody has paid yet.
1156080	1158080	Things that will need to be paid.
1158080	1165080	Whereas pay up is meant to be, you know, a flatmate has already paid for this.
1165080	1167080	Now you need to pay them your share.
1167080	1168080	Okay.
1168080	1171080	So the upcoming payments are assigned, are they?
1171080	1176080	The upcoming payments are sort of more like recurring things that need to happen over time.
1176080	1180080	It's dated to the whole flat, right?
1180080	1183080	Everyone on the flat needs to pay groceries.
1183080	1187080	And then if you go down into pay up, Alex has already paid rent.
1187080	1190080	And you need to pay Alex back for what they paid for your section.
1190080	1193080	Although in this case, that would be like rent for next month.
1193080	1196080	Whereas that would be rent like for last month or whatever.
1196080	1198080	And you still have to pay him for last month.
1198080	1202080	But the idea is that rent is coming up again and someone needs to pay for that.
1202080	1203080	Yep.
1203080	1205080	But you felt like that wasn't intuitive?
1205080	1209080	I feel like this whole sort of conversation has proven that.
1209080	1210080	That's fair.
1210080	1212080	If it's not intuitive enough, that's a glaring flaw.
1212080	1217080	It's hard to, because with the above section, the upcoming payments.
1217080	1224080	I feel like that might make more sense if it was stuff that was specific to the user, the current user.
1224080	1228080	Because that seems like groceries is that $30 in total for the flat.
1228080	1230080	Who's the person that's going to pay that?
1230080	1236080	Do you then need to like talk outside of the app and be like, okay, I'll pay that and then you pay me back in the app.
1236080	1237080	Makes sense.
1237080	1241080	Whereas like you could potentially add in an expense and then assign that to one of the flat members.
1241080	1245080	And then you'd only see the ones that you needed to pay in that upcoming payment.
1245080	1247080	Rather than everything.
1247080	1249080	So you would still want to merge the two then wouldn't you?
1249080	1251080	Potentially no.
1251080	1256080	It's just more of like with the upcoming payments with like how I'm understanding it currently.
1256080	1260080	Those are expenses for the flat in its entirety.
1260080	1261080	Yes.
1261080	1265080	Which means that like anyone who's in the flat could just pick one and pay it and pay it now.
1265080	1266080	Yes.
1266080	1272080	Because I feel like on like my home screen I'd want to see payments that are for me.
1272080	1275080	Not like because I might not be paying the food.
1275080	1279080	So like I don't really need to be seeing that because that's not my responsibility at the moment.
1279080	1284080	Whereas like I would want to see they're like, okay, I'm in charge of groceries this week.
1284080	1286080	There's my groceries payment.
1286080	1290080	And then I'd scroll down to pay up and I'd say, okay, they paid for the food this this week.
1290080	1292080	Let me chuck it across.
1292080	1293080	Okay.
1293080	1294080	Awesome.
1294080	1295080	All right.
1295080	1297080	Is there anything else they want to add?
1297080	1299080	I'd probably make this almost like a drop down.
1299080	1306080	Like instead of upcoming payments being the total, just have it so like each individual upcoming payment.
1306080	1308080	You can see like, oh, John's paid this for it.
1308080	1310080	Bob's paid this.
1310080	1311080	Oh, like the groceries.
1311080	1312080	Yeah.
1312080	1314080	You drop down from the groceries and it'll tell you who's paying it or who's paying it.
1314080	1320080	So each item in upcoming payments you would say John has paid this much.
1320080	1321080	Yeah.
1321080	1327080	I mean, regardless, it is quite a lot of like space just for like text that doesn't really sort of do anything in a way.
1327080	1328080	In the middle of space you mean?
1328080	1329080	Yeah.
1329080	1334080	Like on your home screen, I feel like it should have some extra sort of functionality in a way.
1334080	1335080	Okay.
1335080	1339080	I've got a sort of just like pain in the ass thing, but probably just make the dates a bit bigger.
1339080	1340080	The dates?
1340080	1341080	Oh yeah, that's fair.
1341080	1344080	I mean, to be fair, this is meant to be on a phone that's meant to be closer.
1344080	1348080	Obviously I'm showing it to you on my laptop, but like it is meant to be like in your face
1348080	1352080	a little bit more, but yeah, I can see that it's pretty small.
1352080	1354080	That's it for me.
1354080	1356080	I got nothing else.
1356080	1357080	Awesome.
1357080	1358080	No, no, awesome.
1358080	1359080	These are the kinds of things.
1359080	1360080	This is what I expect from you.
1360080	1363080	The more you give, the more I can cut away and leave the good parts.
1363080	1364080	Absolutely.
1364080	1367080	We're trying to give you some issues.
1367080	1369080	Be as nit-picky as you like.
1369080	1372080	The more issues you can solve, the better you're going to do on that part, right?
1372080	1373080	Exactly, yeah.
1373080	1375080	So anyone got anything else they want to mention?
1375080	1376080	No?
1376080	1377080	No other overall feedback?
1377080	1381080	Just like overall make summative information more accessible.
1381080	1386080	Well not accessible information, more of a main sort of...
1386080	1391080	Yeah, I feel like the app's pretty easy to use when you're like given the tasks that
1391080	1392080	you've got to do.
1392080	1395080	It's just when like, like here, we talk about the whole thing.
1395080	1396080	That sort of...
1396080	1398080	Yeah, it's when you open it up and you have to figure it out yourself.
1398080	1401080	Yeah, and you're sort of overthinking it in a way.
1401080	1406080	I wasn't confused when I was using it at the start, but then...
1406080	1407080	Awesome.
1407080	1409080	Yeah, when you start to think about it, it's like, wait a minute.
1409080	1410080	Yeah.
1410080	1412080	Alright, we've given you 20 minutes where we are going.
1412080	1413080	I think we should stop.
1413080	1414080	Yeah, that's probably good enough.
1414080	1415080	Awesome.
1415080	1416080	Thank you very much.
1416080	1417080	Amazing.
1417080	1418080	Thank you.
1418080	1419080	Bye.
1419080	1420080	Bye.
1420080	1421080	Bye.
1421080	1422080	Bye.
1422080	1423080	Bye.
1423080	1424080	Bye.
1424080	1425080	Bye.
1425080	1426080	Bye.
1426080	1427080	Bye.
1427080	1428080	Bye.
1428080	1429080	Bye.
1429080	1430080	Bye.
1430080	1431080	Bye.
1431080	1432080	Bye.
1432080	1433080	Bye.
1433080	1434080	Bye.
