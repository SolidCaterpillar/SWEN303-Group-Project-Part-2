WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
All right, so you have the app in front of you now.

00:02.840 --> 00:08.240
Your first task will be to add a new recurring expense

00:08.240 --> 00:11.880
and split it among household members.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.280
So please begin.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.480
Once you get to the point, the expense in question

00:19.480 --> 00:21.000
is a rent expense.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.320
Let's say it's about $1,200.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.360
The date is maybe the 31st of March.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.360
And let's say you want to repeat it weekly.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.400
And select the three household members that it applies to.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.400
Just tell me when you feel you're done.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.920
OK, I'm done.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.120
Should I click Create?

00:50.120 --> 00:50.620
Yes.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.880
Can you just voice what's happening now?

00:57.880 --> 01:02.160
OK, I can't seem to click on the Create button

01:02.160 --> 01:05.720
to go to the next page, I guess.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.560
Could you put something in the description for me?

01:08.560 --> 01:09.200
Can I type it?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.120
I don't think you can.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.640
OK, that's broken.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.280
Take my breaks.

01:12.280 --> 01:12.800
Interesting.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.320
OK, I'm scrolling out.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
Cancel out of here.

01:15.320 --> 01:15.820
OK.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.760
Do you want to just quickly try and do that again?

01:23.760 --> 01:24.260
Sure.

01:24.260 --> 01:24.760
Please can.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.720
Let's see if it doesn't break.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.240
Name, category, let's go rent.

01:31.240 --> 01:39.080
$1,200, 31st of March, weekly, three household members.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.960
Maybe just try and put a description in there.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
Oh, OK.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.880
I think I was waiting for the description.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.040
OK, and just press Create.

01:48.120 --> 01:55.360
And interesting, it reset the rent and amount and repeat.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.480
No, it is not.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.880
Do you want to just add Sam again?

01:58.880 --> 01:59.560
Oh, never mind.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.640
It's not even reset them.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.600
It's jumped to cheese.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.200
Oh, I think it's because you made a new expense.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.400
All right, we're going to cancel the,

02:11.400 --> 02:14.160
yeah, we can stop the screen recording there, I think.

02:14.160 --> 02:14.760
That's fine.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.120
Just continue with the next task.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.680
Yeah, no, for the other task.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.440
All right, we'll continue with the next task,

02:20.440 --> 02:23.080
which is to pay an existing expense

02:23.080 --> 02:25.280
and then confirm that it's been removed.

02:25.280 --> 02:30.000
So the expense in question is an expense that Alex has paid

02:30.000 --> 02:34.480
and that you need to now pay him for, them, them for.

02:34.480 --> 02:39.680
That was the power expense, about $80 or so, probably.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.160
Can you verify that that exists?

02:41.160 --> 02:43.640
Oh, food?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.560
Yeah.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.000
Food is $80.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.480
Rent is that much.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.000
Do you want to try expanding?

02:51.000 --> 02:51.500
Yes.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.520
Yes, there we go.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.160
$80.

02:58.160 --> 02:58.640
Perfect.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
Can you pay that for me?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.720
Can you confirm, has it been paid?

03:12.720 --> 03:15.360
Should I go back to the home page?

03:15.360 --> 03:16.640
If you'd like to.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.080
Because I'm not sure what's going on.

03:19.080 --> 03:19.580
Fair enough.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.880
I still have the power?

03:25.880 --> 03:26.960
OK, no worries.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.640
That's all right.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.160
That's fine.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.560
We'll continue with the next task.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.360
Right, yes, that's right.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.040
Talk more about what's going on.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.480
Yes, feel free to voice what's happening, your confusions,

03:38.480 --> 03:42.560
your concerns, what's happening in general, what you tried to do,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.840
what happened instead, that kind of thing.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.720
So in this case, you.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.360
Well, I tried to pay the power.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.320
And it disappeared from the pay section.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.240
Well, it's still here.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.120
But when you went to the home page, it was still there.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.720
I'm not 100% sure whether it did pay.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.240
Could you jump over to the pay section and check for me?

04:04.240 --> 04:05.280
Yes.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.000
Is it there still?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It's the first one, yeah.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.200
All right, good to know.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.240
Should I click the pay button again?

04:19.280 --> 04:20.800
No, let's move on to the next task.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.480
OK, I'll go back to home now.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.680
Sounds good.

04:23.680 --> 04:30.080
All right, next up, I'd like you to look at a past expense.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.240
Let's say garbage from last week.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.160
And can you just tell me who paid that garbage expense

04:37.160 --> 04:38.840
last week?

04:38.840 --> 04:40.720
First, should I go to expense tab?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.760
You say you want to go to the expense tab, OK.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.080
And then what do you want to do?

04:44.080 --> 04:44.720
The past week.

04:44.720 --> 04:45.720
Is that what you said?

04:45.720 --> 04:46.480
Yes, last week.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.800
Last week.

04:47.800 --> 04:55.520
So garbage was 380, flatmate person one and person two.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.160
Awesome.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.000
Thank you very much.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.760
So flatmate person one and person two.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.280
All right, thank you very much.

05:08.280 --> 05:12.680
The next task is to, I'd like you

05:12.680 --> 05:19.200
to look at the insights for rent over the past month or so,

05:19.200 --> 05:23.160
or just look at the monthly insights for rent.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.240
And just tell me what you think of it.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.200
What do you see?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.840
Well, I see a pie chart, which clearly describes rent

05:29.840 --> 05:38.920
being 70% of my expenses, and it totaling to $1,800 monthly.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.160
OK, good to know.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.280
Can we move on to task five?

05:52.280 --> 05:55.440
Sorry, do we want to have her correct or not?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.280
OK.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.760
Do we want to move on to task five?

05:58.760 --> 06:03.960
Task five is, I'd like you to enable,

06:03.960 --> 06:07.200
I'd like you to adjust the color scheme of the app,

06:07.200 --> 06:10.920
and maybe the contrast too, if you'd like.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.360
And just sort of talk about what

06:12.360 --> 06:14.640
you're doing as you're doing that, what the outcome is.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.800
Let's go back.

06:16.800 --> 06:23.240
OK, I went to the, when I go to the, oh, what's up here?

06:23.240 --> 06:26.160
Clicked on the navigation three bars.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.280
Went to app settings, display settings,

06:29.280 --> 06:31.920
and assume I can go to the dark mode.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.440
Oh, shit, that's pretty cool.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.920
OK.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.000
And high contrast, oh, wow.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.160
That's pretty cool.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.320
What does system mean?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.080
Is it just like?

06:47.680 --> 06:49.440
OK, good to know.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.560
Typically, the system, the app, the mobile device

06:53.560 --> 06:55.240
is either set to dock or level, so we

06:55.240 --> 06:57.080
can try and learn from that.

06:57.080 --> 07:01.320
So then shouldn't that be the default one?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.400
That's some very useful feedback, thank you.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.800
All right, but can you just change some settings

07:05.800 --> 07:09.080
and tell me what you changed and what you think of it?

07:11.200 --> 07:13.240
Contact and support.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.440
I can.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.160
Sorry, I meant accessibility settings.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.000
Oh, accessibility.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.480
Yes.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.040
That you changed.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.280
Oh, the color themes.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.520
Just need to read.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.680
Yes.

07:27.680 --> 07:32.040
Well, I changed to dark mode and to high contrast.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.120
All right, and do those work well?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.960
Yes, those work well.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.840
Visibly changed across the page.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.000
Awesome.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.920
We'll move on to the next task now,

07:44.920 --> 07:49.400
which is I'd like you to get some help from the app.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.760
I'd like you to go and see the FAQ section, perhaps,

07:54.760 --> 07:59.160
and have a look at some of the frequently asked questions.

07:59.160 --> 07:59.680
OK.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.520
I'm on the frequently asked questions,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.640
and I can click on the questions available

08:04.640 --> 08:07.280
and quickly read through them.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.840
OK.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.440
Well, the first one anyways.

08:10.480 --> 08:10.960
Awesome.

08:10.960 --> 08:11.640
Let's continue.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.280
Let's I'd like you to click on the call.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.160
I'd like you to find contact support

08:17.160 --> 08:20.440
and fill out a support form for me.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.280
Tapped out the first.

08:22.280 --> 08:27.000
I think I've already, hmm, one second.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.400
I can't seem to click on, let me just, like that.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.240
Could I just get you to speak up a little bit

08:35.240 --> 08:37.800
from the microphone, especially since there's background noise?

08:37.800 --> 08:38.400
Yes.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.360
I just changed my whole set up to light mode,

08:41.360 --> 08:43.320
just to see if I can, yep.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.760
So basically, when I was on the dark mode on high contrast,

08:45.760 --> 08:47.120
I couldn't see the name.

08:47.120 --> 08:47.720
OK.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.160
All right, thank you very much.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.880
And now I just click the name, click the email.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.360
OK, could you submit a contact support form for me?

08:54.360 --> 08:56.520
Yeah, I'm just going to click on the message.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.880
I don't know if that types up.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.680
OK, it's sent through.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.920
Could you just confirm that it's been sent through?

09:02.920 --> 09:05.360
Yeah, you just need to smack it a few times.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.840
OK, there you go.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
Take my issues.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
Yeah.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.840
Sent.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.840
Oh, message sent.

09:10.840 --> 09:11.840
Perfect.

09:11.840 --> 09:12.840
Thank you very much.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
And it also has a clear message saying

09:13.840 --> 09:17.200
that I will be able to, like, feed back to you after 24,

09:17.200 --> 09:18.200
48 hours.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.200
Awesome.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.200
Thank you very much.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.720
I believe that is all of the questions, of the tasks.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.240
I will now turn off the recording.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
OK.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
Thank you very much.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
Thank you.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
Thank you.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
Thank you.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
Thank you.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
Thank you.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
Thank you.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Thank you.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
Thank you.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
Thank you.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
Thank you.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
Thank you.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.240
Thank you.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.240
Thank you.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.240
Thank you.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
Thank you.

09:42.240 --> 09:42.740
Thank you.
