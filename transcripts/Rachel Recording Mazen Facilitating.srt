1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
All right, so you have the app in front of you now.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,240
Your first task will be to add a new recurring expense

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
and split it among household members.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,280
So please begin.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,480
Once you get to the point, the expense in question

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,000
is a rent expense.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,320
Let's say it's about $1,200.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,360
The date is maybe the 31st of March.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
And let's say you want to repeat it weekly.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,400
And select the three household members that it applies to.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,400
Just tell me when you feel you're done.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,920
OK, I'm done.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Should I click Create?

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,620
Yes.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,880
Can you just voice what's happening now?

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,160
OK, I can't seem to click on the Create button

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,720
to go to the next page, I guess.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,560
Could you put something in the description for me?

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,200
Can I type it?

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
I don't think you can.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,640
OK, that's broken.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,280
Take my breaks.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,800
Interesting.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,320
OK, I'm scrolling out.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Cancel out of here.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,820
OK.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,760
Do you want to just quickly try and do that again?

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,260
Sure.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,760
Please can.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,720
Let's see if it doesn't break.

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,240
Name, category, let's go rent.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,080
$1,200, 31st of March, weekly, three household members.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,960
Maybe just try and put a description in there.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Oh, OK.

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
I think I was waiting for the description.

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,040
OK, and just press Create.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,360
And interesting, it reset the rent and amount and repeat.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
No, it is not.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,880
Do you want to just add Sam again?

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,560
Oh, never mind.

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
It's not even reset them.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,600
It's jumped to cheese.

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Oh, I think it's because you made a new expense.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,400
All right, we're going to cancel the,

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,160
yeah, we can stop the screen recording there, I think.

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,760
That's fine.

47
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,120
Just continue with the next task.

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,680
Yeah, no, for the other task.

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,440
All right, we'll continue with the next task,

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
which is to pay an existing expense

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,280
and then confirm that it's been removed.

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,000
So the expense in question is an expense that Alex has paid

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
and that you need to now pay him for, them, them for.

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,680
That was the power expense, about $80 or so, probably.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,160
Can you verify that that exists?

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,640
Oh, food?

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,560
Yeah.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,000
Food is $80.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Rent is that much.

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you want to try expanding?

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,500
Yes.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Yes, there we go.

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,160
$80.

64
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,640
Perfect.

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Can you pay that for me?

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,720
Can you confirm, has it been paid?

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
Should I go back to the home page?

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
If you'd like to.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,080
Because I'm not sure what's going on.

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,580
Fair enough.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,880
I still have the power?

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,960
OK, no worries.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,640
That's all right.

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,160
That's fine.

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,560
We'll continue with the next task.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
Right, yes, that's right.

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,040
Talk more about what's going on.

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,480
Yes, feel free to voice what's happening, your confusions,

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,560
your concerns, what's happening in general, what you tried to do,

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
what happened instead, that kind of thing.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,720
So in this case, you.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,360
Well, I tried to pay the power.

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,320
And it disappeared from the pay section.

84
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, it's still here.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,120
But when you went to the home page, it was still there.

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm not 100% sure whether it did pay.

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,240
Could you jump over to the pay section and check for me?

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
Yes.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,000
Is it there still?

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's the first one, yeah.

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,200
All right, good to know.

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,240
Should I click the pay button again?

93
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,800
No, let's move on to the next task.

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
OK, I'll go back to home now.

95
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
Sounds good.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,080
All right, next up, I'd like you to look at a past expense.

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,240
Let's say garbage from last week.

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,160
And can you just tell me who paid that garbage expense

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,840
last week?

100
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,720
First, should I go to expense tab?

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,760
You say you want to go to the expense tab, OK.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,080
And then what do you want to do?

103
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,720
The past week.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Is that what you said?

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes, last week.

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,800
Last week.

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,520
So garbage was 380, flatmate person one and person two.

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Awesome.

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank you very much.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,760
So flatmate person one and person two.

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,280
All right, thank you very much.

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,680
The next task is to, I'd like you

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,200
to look at the insights for rent over the past month or so,

114
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,160
or just look at the monthly insights for rent.

115
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,240
And just tell me what you think of it.

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,200
What do you see?

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,840
Well, I see a pie chart, which clearly describes rent

118
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:38,920
being 70% of my expenses, and it totaling to $1,800 monthly.

119
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,160
OK, good to know.

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,280
Can we move on to task five?

121
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,440
Sorry, do we want to have her correct or not?

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,280
OK.

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Do we want to move on to task five?

124
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,960
Task five is, I'd like you to enable,

125
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,200
I'd like you to adjust the color scheme of the app,

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,920
and maybe the contrast too, if you'd like.

127
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
And just sort of talk about what

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,640
you're doing as you're doing that, what the outcome is.

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,800
Let's go back.

130
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,240
OK, I went to the, when I go to the, oh, what's up here?

131
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,160
Clicked on the navigation three bars.

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Went to app settings, display settings,

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,920
and assume I can go to the dark mode.

134
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,440
Oh, shit, that's pretty cool.

135
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,920
OK.

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,000
And high contrast, oh, wow.

137
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
That's pretty cool.

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,320
What does system mean?

139
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,080
Is it just like?

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
OK, good to know.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,560
Typically, the system, the app, the mobile device

142
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,240
is either set to dock or level, so we

143
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,080
can try and learn from that.

144
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,320
So then shouldn't that be the default one?

145
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
That's some very useful feedback, thank you.

146
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
All right, but can you just change some settings

147
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,080
and tell me what you changed and what you think of it?

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
Contact and support.

149
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,440
I can.

150
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Sorry, I meant accessibility settings.

151
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, accessibility.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Yes.

153
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
That you changed.

154
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh, the color themes.

155
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,520
Just need to read.

156
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
Yes.

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,040
Well, I changed to dark mode and to high contrast.

158
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,120
All right, and do those work well?

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes, those work well.

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,840
Visibly changed across the page.

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Awesome.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
We'll move on to the next task now,

163
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,400
which is I'd like you to get some help from the app.

164
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,760
I'd like you to go and see the FAQ section, perhaps,

165
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,160
and have a look at some of the frequently asked questions.

166
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,680
OK.

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm on the frequently asked questions,

168
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,640
and I can click on the questions available

169
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,280
and quickly read through them.

170
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
OK.

171
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Well, the first one anyways.

172
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,960
Awesome.

173
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,640
Let's continue.

174
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,280
Let's I'd like you to click on the call.

175
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,160
I'd like you to find contact support

176
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,440
and fill out a support form for me.

177
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Tapped out the first.

178
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,000
I think I've already, hmm, one second.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,400
I can't seem to click on, let me just, like that.

180
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,240
Could I just get you to speak up a little bit

181
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,800
from the microphone, especially since there's background noise?

182
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes.

183
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,360
I just changed my whole set up to light mode,

184
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,320
just to see if I can, yep.

185
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,760
So basically, when I was on the dark mode on high contrast,

186
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
I couldn't see the name.

187
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
OK.

188
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,160
All right, thank you very much.

189
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,880
And now I just click the name, click the email.

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,360
OK, could you submit a contact support form for me?

191
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah, I'm just going to click on the message.

192
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,880
I don't know if that types up.

193
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
OK, it's sent through.

194
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
Could you just confirm that it's been sent through?

195
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,360
Yeah, you just need to smack it a few times.

196
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
OK, there you go.

197
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Take my issues.

198
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah.

199
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Sent.

200
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Oh, message sent.

201
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Perfect.

202
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Thank you very much.

203
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
And it also has a clear message saying

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,200
that I will be able to, like, feed back to you after 24,

205
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
48 hours.

206
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Awesome.

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Thank you very much.

208
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,720
I believe that is all of the questions, of the tasks.

209
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,240
I will now turn off the recording.

210
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
OK.

211
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Thank you very much.

212
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Thank you.

213
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Thank you.

214
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Thank you.

215
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Thank you.

216
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Thank you.

217
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you.

218
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Thank you.

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Thank you.

220
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Thank you.

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Thank you.

222
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Thank you.

223
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you.

224
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Thank you.

225
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Thank you.

226
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Thank you.

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,740
Thank you.
