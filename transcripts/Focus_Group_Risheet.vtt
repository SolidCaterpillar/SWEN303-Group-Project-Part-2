WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
We're all ready?

00:01.000 --> 00:01.500
Yep.

00:01.500 --> 00:02.000
Easy.

00:02.000 --> 00:02.500
You guys are all good?

00:02.500 --> 00:03.000
Yep.

00:03.000 --> 00:03.500
Sweet as.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.000
You have more to learn, by the way.

00:05.000 --> 00:05.500
OK, yeah.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.000
So just wondering, what were your first impressions

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
using the app?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I thought it was really intuitive.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
It wasn't hard to find the different screens

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
that we need to navigate to or do the different ones.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.500
I really like the icons that are at the bottom,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
even across the entire page as well,

00:22.500 --> 00:25.000
telling you what each thing does.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
So it's pretty like, even if you don't read it, it's fine.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.500
You can still understand what's going on.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.000
OK, sweet.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I think the only really big issue I had with this

00:34.000 --> 00:36.500
was the bottom part, the colors used.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.000
I think that the green at the bottom is a bit too dark,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
because it doesn't contrast that well with the black.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
So it can be a little hard to read the text,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
especially if you didn't have good vision.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.500
I see.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
So the bottom part kind of had an issue,

00:48.500 --> 00:50.000
in terms of contrast being a thing.

00:50.000 --> 00:50.500
Yeah.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.000
If there was a bit of a lighter color,

00:52.000 --> 00:53.500
or if it was white on the color instead,

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000
I think it would have worked better.

00:55.000 --> 00:55.500
OK.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, I guess in that sense, as you mentioned,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
now the icons I feel like are fine for me.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
It's just like the text at the bottom kind of got blended.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.500
For me, I'm just looking at it right now,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.000
because when I did do the testing,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.500
I didn't even look at the work.

01:07.500 --> 01:12.500
But now I'm looking at it, the text blends in.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.000
So yeah, probably like a lighter bit at the bottom.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
OK, a lighter color.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.500
It kind of gives you a good vibe on how to navigate.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.000
Yeah.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.500
That kind of leads quite nicely into our next question,

01:21.500 --> 01:24.000
which is kind of describe your experience kind of navigating

01:24.000 --> 01:25.500
about these tasks.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.000
Like what are kind of some difficulties you had,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
all that sort of benefits?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
One issue that I heard, I'm actually

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
trying to remember what the task was.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
OK, we had to go to this one, and then help and support.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh yeah, the help and support button doesn't work.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yeah, I heard that issue.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.500
OK, so in the menu, help and support

01:42.500 --> 01:44.000
doesn't direct you to anything?

01:44.000 --> 01:44.500
Yeah.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.000
Yeah.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
OK.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
But everything else is fine.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.500
I guess for me, since I didn't actually

01:49.500 --> 01:51.000
even click on the help and support,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.500
because I went to contact support immediately.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.000
So it worked fine for me.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.500
But yeah, I guess if we could link back

01:58.500 --> 02:02.000
to this particular page here, it would make more sense

02:02.000 --> 02:07.500
for a user just having more freedom into the app as well.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.000
OK.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, another thing within the app as well,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.500
when it went to dark mode and high contrast,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
you can't see the text.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
Yes, yes, yes.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
Yeah, like Cassie disappears.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.500
So you don't know whether it's been typed out.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Yeah, that's a good bug.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, so that's one of the minor issues

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
that can be fixed immediately.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.500
And also, I forgot to mention this within testing,

02:32.500 --> 02:35.000
but it doesn't stay to the thing.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.500
So you don't know whether that's right.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
You can kind of, if you read it, you know.

02:39.500 --> 02:43.500
But if you think about it, like, oh, is that what it is?

02:43.500 --> 02:44.500
Sounds good.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.000
What about other kind of tasks?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.500
Did you have any trouble navigating things

02:47.500 --> 02:49.000
besides settings?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.500
Yes.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.000
I know there's a whole button up here to go back.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.500
But I was looking at buttons down.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.000
For me, when I use my apps, I normally

02:58.000 --> 02:59.500
have buttons down here.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
I guess it's mainly the user on the other apps as well.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
I use TikTok a lot.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.500
It has all the, yeah, so I was kind of like, oh, OK.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
OK, cool.

03:11.500 --> 03:16.500
And also, it doesn't really have a home button.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.500
It goes to user.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
You can go back, but I don't know what happened here.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Yeah, right.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
OK, cool.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And no other tasks?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.500
Yeah, what are the things you liked about the navigation

03:29.500 --> 03:32.500
that you would say would be kept?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.500
I think the way that information is laid out

03:35.500 --> 03:39.000
is quite good, especially on the payments.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.500
I like that it's separate to today, past week, et cetera.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.000
So it's not just one big block of text,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.500
because it can be quite overwhelming.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.000
People don't look through all that.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So I think the information is separate as well.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.500
I like how there's also, for that information,

03:52.000 --> 03:53.500
if you press down, it comes up here.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.500
And for a quick, extra information for a user,

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000
it would be like, OK, I paid this person.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Perfect.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.500
And I'll go into another tab.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, easy.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
So yeah.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I also liked how it was similar to past and future

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
at the top, more than other expenses.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.500
Yeah.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.000
Cool.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.500
I appreciate that.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.000
They're all on Discord.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah, sorry about that.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.500
OK, and a bit of a quicker question.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.500
How do you feel about the color scheme?

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
No, I wouldn't choose it.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.000
OK.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
I think that the shades of green don't match well.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.500
I like the darker greens, but I think

04:33.500 --> 04:36.500
that the lighter green is a different hue,

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
if that makes sense.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.000
So I think it's too lime.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It doesn't have enough blue in it.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.500
So I would say I like the colors of this.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.500
It's just the top and the bottom half of it,

04:48.500 --> 04:51.500
which kind of doesn't go well with the app.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
I would say that's fine.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.000
OK, cool.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So if you were to change that, what would you guys

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
feel kind of matched?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.500
I would take out the blue.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.500
I would take out the navy blue, and I'd make it white.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.000
I don't think any other color.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Something like white for the border on,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.500
kind of like showing you, hey, you can add more things here.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.000
OK.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.500
Or maybe like having this lighter shades of green

05:09.500 --> 05:10.500
or something similar to that.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
Or I would make this white.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
The dash would almost take white to contrast it.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
Or white.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.500
In fact, swapping the contrast colors, say, with orange,

05:18.500 --> 05:21.500
would you say would be a better option?

05:21.500 --> 05:25.500
Or maybe something more similar.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.000
I would say that you come with the orange,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.500
but I would say it would not go well with this.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.500
I think contrast, well, it just wouldn't look that.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.000
When it comes to color schemes, I

05:34.000 --> 05:36.500
think it's better to be simpler rather than more complex.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
So utilizing white and black and contrast

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
more and using the same two colors

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
rather than having lots of different shades

05:43.500 --> 05:44.500
of the same color.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.500
I would say having one bright color within the app

05:49.500 --> 05:52.000
for buttons or maybe for something like these

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
to show, OK, we have color.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.500
But having the two main, maybe black and white or black

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
and some other color that is focused on the app as well

06:00.500 --> 06:03.500
could represent you as a company and the app as well.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.000
Cool.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Appreciate it.

06:05.000 --> 06:05.500
OK.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.500
And final question.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.000
If it's where we are, would you use it?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Why or why not?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.500
What would be some good things and what

06:11.500 --> 06:14.000
would be some drawbacks using it?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I actually have a really similar app to this

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
that I use with my flatmates.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And I think that this has more functionality

06:20.000 --> 06:22.500
for doing different things because it tracks your upcoming

06:22.500 --> 06:24.000
payments, which would be useful.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.500
But the app that I use is definitely a lot simpler,

06:26.500 --> 06:29.000
just because it focuses really on those really simple

06:29.000 --> 06:32.500
add an expense and pay it with your flatmates.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.000
So I'd probably stick with that just

06:34.000 --> 06:35.500
because that's all that I need it for.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.000
But if I wanted an app that could

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
track my expenses and my budget and stuff,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.500
then I think this would be useful.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.000
I would use it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.500
It kind of reminds me a little bit.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.500
So any significant drawbacks to the experience using the app?

06:52.500 --> 06:55.000
What does it show?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.500
For me, not really.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.500
Nothing in particular.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.000
There were the minor issues that we had.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
But other than that, it's pretty good app.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.500
Thank you.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.000
Cool.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.500
Yeah.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.500
I think that's pretty much it.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.000
Rashid, Amish, nothing else?

07:09.000 --> 07:09.500
No.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.000
Cool.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Thank you for your time.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.500
Thank you.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.500
No worries.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.000
Cool.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
So what are all your names?

07:15.000 --> 07:15.500
Rachel.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.000
Rachel.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Arianna.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.500
Karen.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.000
Cool.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.500
Yeah.
