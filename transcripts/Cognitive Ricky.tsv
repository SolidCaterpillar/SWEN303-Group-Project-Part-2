13980	16100	You'll get a roar and filtered bullets
21160	26720	Good okay, you gotta test our abs to see if you understand the tusks, okay?
30000	32000	Okay
33840	39120	Of adding a new recruit expense and splitting it amongst the household members
39160	45820	So add a new expense and then split it. Yep. Okay, so we'll go to the ad expense button. That's in the bottom
46120	48120	Yeah, and it will come up
48680	52880	Enter the name. Is this the name for the expense? Yep

65680	67680	repeat weekly
70200	72200	31st of May
73160	75160	It's coming up as different values
76720	80600	Try to click again, it's not interactable
88960	90960	Oh
97200	99640	Yeah, it's coming up with cheese and then hello and in

104640	110960	Did you want to weekly repeat sweet and then split with everybody wasn't it? Oh three three. Yeah, sweet
110960	112960	So all of them
113160	116520	And then create the expense using the button down here
117520	122320	Okay, it's coming up is there wasn't anything there it's a good era
123280	124800	Letting me know
124800	126800	So we wanted it for rent
127720	129720	the immense
130840	135580	1200 okay, it's coming up as 10 and in the repeat was weekly
140400	145240	And we want it to be with Sam as well because we want it to be split with three people, let's see what happens
146520	148160	a
148160	150280	Very funky blue cheese so flat true
159440	161440	Okay, I'm assuming that the name
164560	170560	Okay, try well maybe I can exit out and yeah, let's try again let's go at expense
171880	173880	We're entering the name
174600	176600	Cheese still
181560	188060	Yeah, and we go ran into the amount is there it's coming up as hello
188060	190060	Oh
191180	192780	Sure
192780	194780	weekly
197900	199300	Description
199300	204420	Let's try and create it. Okay, it's coming up with an error here. Let's try again
205780	211180	Rinse inter amount is 10 select values weekly
218860	220860	Okay
221460	223460	Creating itself
223820	227020	Don't quite know what's up with that. Okay. Okay, we move in next
230740	233820	It just wouldn't create an expense it would when
234780	237060	the first values were entered
237780	242780	It would then give error messages saying some of the values were blank
243380	248020	Even though they were filled out and then on filling them out again
248780	252340	Clicking the create expense button would just not do something. I wouldn't do anything
254460	256460	Okay, we move to the second task
257300	262460	The second test is to ensure the functionality of payment and existing expense
263220	271060	And verify it removed from the list. Okay, so we're paying an expense. I want to go into the pay up section
271500	276540	And I will guess pay the click the pay button, okay
278580	279900	Open
279900	287080	Alex and you select the power the power cool. Yeah, I'm here. I see the Alex categories
287080	291640	I see the power I will click pay their pay for power. Yes
292300	297300	It is now disappeared from the list and I imagine if I go to home. Yeah
297580	299580	Okay
299580	307040	Okay, the next task is to confirm the ability to view past expense and verify payment history, okay payment
307040	312740	So there's an expenses tab. This is going into yeah, I can see the history from today
313300	317620	The past week and the past month. Okay. Yeah, so you had to locate
318420	325220	Garbage garbage and verify the detail who paid the coverage for that. Okay, so garbage was paid in the past week
326060	331460	$380, you know, it was paid by person one and person two on the 27th of May. Okay, sweet
333220	335220	The next task is to
335220	340500	Verify the inside features for the rent category and ensure equity data visualization
340620	346060	Okay, so we'll go into the insights tab. I can see a very nice pie chart here. Yeah
346580	353260	We've got the top categories for rent, which is indeed the top category power is next. Yeah, then it should be broadband
353260	357460	Yep, and food and other. Yeah. Yeah, so I want you to
358140	365140	Click the event category. The rent category is being clicked. I now have a bar chart with the week. Okay
365820	371880	So you had to view the monthly the monthly I now have the bar chart with four values on it
371880	379500	It was paid consistently it seems with consistent rent. So they're all the same value. Yep, all 450. Yep. Looks good
379540	384500	Okay, your next step is to test the customization option for display and accessibility
385300	386740	ensure
386740	393560	Usability for all users. Okay, so that will probably be in the three bar menu. I'm thinking we're going in here
394080	396080	probably app settings
396780	398780	And we wanted to do
398800	399860	accessibility
399860	404160	Which isn't quite here, but it's probably on the display. Yes
405160	410960	And then there's dark mode system and different contrasts so we wanted accessibility
410960	416560	So let's say we go colorblind friendly. It does indeed change the colors
417640	419140	Okay
419140	422400	Yeah, and it stays as you go through that. Yep. I
423380	425380	Want you to try other?
425640	428900	Accessibility see what you see. Okay, let's go back into
429820	437420	Display so there's the dark mode. Yeah, that works nicely. We've got high contrast which does that as well?
438460	440460	The system do something. I
441200	443200	imagine
447380	449260	All works well
449260	452900	Okay, your last time is to help test the help and support spontaneity
453500	458860	Open support ensuring user can find information and contact support if needed perfect
458900	465940	That will again probably be in the three bar menu help and supports right there. Good. It's not showing as interactable
470860	476660	Try app setting app settings if we go into absent. Yep. Okay. There is a helping sport thing in app settings
477020	479900	That could be one thing to just have as a little issue
480540	482540	It's in two different places
483140	485140	So we'd want to contact support
485620	487620	Yeah, and then we'd want to fill out our information
488220	493780	Our email the message that we have and then we could send it and it comes up with the confirmation
501020	507700	No, it was all very intuitive yeah, no, it was easy to move around the buttons made sense
508460	512060	There was good contrast with the interactable areas
512060	514060	I
514620	518620	Didn't have to second-guess myself on anything it all made sense to use
520460	525500	The only thing that kind of went wrong was just a figma issue which the figma was better
525500	529460	I imagine it wouldn't have gone wrong in the first place and it would have worked as it was intended
530020	532920	So I didn't really have any negative feedback to give
533620	535620	Okay, what about us one any?
537340	539940	Yeah expense one the expense stuff made sense
540940	547140	But I had coated you know, yeah, that's just the figma thing it'll kind of make sense to use
549540	553460	Good functionalities in there you had your history with all the information
554180	557780	Yeah, I like the bear with the variety you guys have in there
557780	561740	I think the the traversal options you have is good. I like the tabs
561820	565300	Did I see that it was part of it was swipeable and some like that
565300	569660	Yeah, so you've got some swipe functionality which I think is really cool
571780	576020	That like yet you've got good headers you've got all that it's all in there
577220	580020	Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you
