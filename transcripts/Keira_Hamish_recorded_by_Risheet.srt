1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Cool, okay, task one, could you verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,920
and splitting it amongst all of the household members?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Make sure you speak out loud.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Okay, so, is it add expense button at the bottom right, so I'm just going to go with

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
that.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I'm just going to add a name, it seems like it's compulsory, so I'm just going to fill

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
out the rest of the things we're all with.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,920
I can't type it, but it's, does that fill something in for me, which it works, because

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
I don't want to type anyway.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm going to select rent, because it said it was rent, and I'll enter an amount.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
I can't enter an amount?

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Oh, it gave me an amount, fantastic.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
That's really expensive.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm glad my rent isn't that much.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Alright, let me add a date.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
I think it will add one for me again.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Yep, it did, fantastic.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,840
And I want to make it recurring, so I'm going to select a value, and rent, for that much

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,840
rent, you should be paying it every month, so I'm going to go monthly, and I want to

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,840
split it equally with all flatmates, right?

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,760
So I'll select everybody, me, Alex, and Sam.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I'll add a description, I guess I'll let it add it for me, right for the three of us,

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
love it.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,760
I'll press the create button at the bottom.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm just not letting it press it.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Okay.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,760
It's not letting it press it.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah, I believe that might be an issue with the app, so we can just continue from there.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
That's all good.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Make note of that.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Cool, okay, task two.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Could you ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense, and verify that it's

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
removed?

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay.

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
So, you're wanting to pay an amount that you're owing to somebody.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Okay.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,680
So, I've got my upcoming, so I don't think I'm talking about that.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I think I'm going to pay someone who I owe money to, so I'll try pay Alex for rent,

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:08,600
not, I'm trying to click on, so I initially tried to click on the user name of the person,

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
it doesn't work, so I've pressed the pay button instead.

41
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
And now I've got all my list of things I need to pay, which is great.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
So I'm going to pay rent, and then I'll press the pay button.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It's less than big, which is cool.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I don't know if I should look for it.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Okay, it seems like the app wants me to go with the power one, which is fine.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Oh, it's green.

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
It's cute.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Pay for power.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Yes.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I would love to do that.

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Sweet.

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
It looks like it's been paid.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Now, I'm just going to see if I can confirm it.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Or if I can leave the screen.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
That would also be fine.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Oh, I'm lost to my inside.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
That's fun.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Can I go home from there?

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
No.

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Cool.

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm kind of stuck in this domain, I think.

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Okay, cool.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
So you've removed the...

65
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Oh, there I go.

66
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Sweet.

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,440
So you removed it, and then you were stuck on what screen?

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Sorry?

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,440
I was stuck on the pay screen, so this screen.

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Right.

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Because I think for this, because the colours are kind of darker, I assumed it was blurred

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,440
out or in the background, so I didn't realise I could actually still interact with this

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
screen.

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Okay.

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
That makes sense.

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
I think I would have been looking for a back button or something.

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah.

78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
That makes sense.

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Awesome.

80
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Cool.

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
And if you just go back to the dashboard.

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Awesome.

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Cool.

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm going to go back to past expenses from the previous week and find out who paid for

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
one of them.

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Okay.

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
So I'm thinking about past expenses.

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
The first thing I look at is an expenses tab.

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm going to go to that.

90
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm looking at the past week.

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
That probably includes today as well.

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
So there's all these three.

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Back to expenses?

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Yeah.

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Past week, played the garbage.

96
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Paid for some food.

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Paid for some rent.

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Is there anything else?

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
No.

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
That's all.

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Cool.

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:04:03,120
And task four is validate the insights feature for the rent category and ensure that you

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
can see the data for it.

104
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,360
So you're just viewing the rent category insights, specifically for rent.

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay.

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh, insights.

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
All right.

108
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
So insights being the bottom here.

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
All right.

110
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
And I want to look at the rent category.

111
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
So I'm going to click on rent.

112
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
See what happens.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Oh, I see it.

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,360
I see today I paid 50.

115
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,360
If I press on monthly, I pay 50 every week.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Which makes a lot of sense.

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
That's how rent works.

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Sweet.

119
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Sweet.

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Awesome.

121
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Task five, test the customization options for the display and accessibility.

122
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay.

123
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Yeah.

124
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,360
So if I'm thinking about accessibility, I'm always going to go here.

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
I see settings.

126
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
That's good.

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Display settings.

128
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,360
It probably would be in display settings, I would guess.

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Oh, yeah.

130
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Accessibility.

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
High contrast and colorblind friendly.

132
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Let me try high contrast.

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Nice.

134
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Dark mode.

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I like it.

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Colorblind friendly.

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Oh, yeah.

138
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
So it's all the same color.

139
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Or it's the same color scheme.

140
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
So there's people with color.

141
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Cool.

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Is there anything else?

143
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Cool.

144
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Just test the light dark mode.

145
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Make sure that works.

146
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Yeah.

147
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Dark mode seems to work.

148
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Follow system.

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Cool.

150
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Easy.

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Cool.

152
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
And if you just go back to default.

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
That's okay.

154
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Just on the display settings.

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Sorry.

156
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Higher.

157
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Yeah.

158
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
That's all good.

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Sweet.

160
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Cool.

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
And just go back to the dashboard.

162
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Perfect.

163
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Cool.

164
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Task six, test the help and support functionality.

165
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
So first go to the frequently answered questions and look at that.

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,360
And then try and submit a help request.

167
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Okay.

168
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm going to go to this menu again.

169
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
It's kind of always my default if I think about settings and stuff.

170
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Help and support's right there.

171
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
So I'm going to go there.

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm not allowed to click on it.

173
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Cool.

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay.

175
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,360
If we could continue by just go to app settings.

176
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Oh, I see.

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Okay.

178
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Help and support.

179
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Okay.

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
So I want to look at frequently asked questions first.

181
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
The purpose of it.

182
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Just that one.

183
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
That's all good.

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
And then I want to submit a help request.

185
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Contact support.

186
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
And just input there.

187
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Do an email.

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
And my deep concern.

189
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
And I can send it.

190
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Nice.

191
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Okay, cool.

192
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Awesome.

193
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
And any general thoughts on any of the tasks?

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I thought they were pretty good.

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm pretty impressed with what you actually put together and the time we were given.

196
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,360
I like the separation of who you have to pay and your upcoming payments.

197
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
I do think it's a lot for one app to do.

198
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I think more often apps would work for either one thing or the other.

199
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
So I think it could be a little confusing to have so much functionality in one thing.

200
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
But if you were an experienced user and you figured out how to use it, it would be awesome.

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Cool.

202
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,360
And any big difficulties with any of the tasks?

203
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I don't think so.

204
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I think probably the main thing would just be with the help thing, not being able to

205
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
access it there.

206
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
But I assume if it was a real prototype, that wouldn't be an issue.

207
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Cool.

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Awesome.

209
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Sweet.

210
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
And that's it for now.

211
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Awesome.

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Thank you so much.

213
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Thank you.

214
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Hell yeah.

215
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,860
Thank you.
