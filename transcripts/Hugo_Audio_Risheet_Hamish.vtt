WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Yeah, and we can also screen card all the phones to see where they're testing and stuff.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Fuck, that's not a bad idea.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Are you guys just doing it on your laptop?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
I don't know, yeah, that was our plan.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
I mean, you can just download the Figma app.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Just download the Figma app, as long as you have the flows.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Screen recording's good.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
It doesn't really matter too much for usability.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You have to record that.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
For the testing, you can see how long it takes for each one.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I suppose you can record on the laptop as well.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah, I'm not using my laptop, I'm using my phone.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh, yeah, you can use that.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
So, officially we're going to start now.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
So, welcome to this testing, I guess.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
We're going to be testing our prototype, which is for a Flatmates Expense app.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Really?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, it is.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
So, just go through the app.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm going to be giving you some tasks which you have to go through and try and complete them.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Make sure you say what you're thinking and just go through your step, take your time.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
But just make sure you can tell me what you're thinking about in each step.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Right, so I'm assuming you filled the consent form earlier, so that's all good.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
And we will be recording the voice and also your inputs, I guess, for this test for future use.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
But we will be leaving the data after the assignment is done, so that's all that.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
So, I'm just going to be setting this up.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
It's just going to take a minute.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
It's all good, just keep recording.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
We're just bashing you.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay, okay, that's fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, that's why we are here.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
I would go for the seat form.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, I was confused for a second.

02:00.000 --> 02:16.000
And the screen recording will also record your voice and the things you answer.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
It's pretty cool, Figma, because that's how it looks.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay, so I'm going to be starting the recording now, and I'm going to hand you the phone.

02:25.000 --> 02:39.000
So, this is the testing we're just going to start, and your first task will be verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
So, you'll be adding a new recurring expense and verifying that it has actually been added.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
And when adding the recurring expense, you'll be splitting it among household members.

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
Okay, so I'm clicking add expense, because that's like the standard Google thing.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm just making this up, right?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Read.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Category.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
What did you say it was again?

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
Just any expense.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
1,200? I don't think any of ours work in that way either.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
There we go, there's our date done.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
And repeat. Did you say how often?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
It doesn't say how often, but just choose your favorite.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Every week. I'm going to split it with Sam and Alex and me.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
My description.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Whatever it says for me.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm going to click create.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Sweet.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And then I'm done.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm going to go into expenses and look at future expenses.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
And then, I can't remember what I even set it to.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Just verify it's been added, I guess.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
What was it? 1,200 or something.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
I assume it would be there.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Okay, that's fine.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
That's the first task which is done, so let's just go back to the homepage.

04:13.000 --> 04:26.000
The next task is to ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense and removing it from the list.

04:26.000 --> 04:37.000
Basically, there's going to be an existing expense which you already paid, but you're going to be paying up the expense to another person.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Just making sure it's already been done.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
What would you be doing in this case?

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I assume these are my most recent expenses, so I'll go pay up.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Then I'll pay Alex back for his rent.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Okay.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I'll click pay.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
What is it? Just the bottom one that works. Pay.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Then I'm paying for power.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yep.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And then what was the last bit?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Just make sure it's been removed.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
It's been removed?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yep.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, I'd just look in there.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Okay, that's nice.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Then go back to the homepage.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
Your third task is just view the past expenses and verify the payment history.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
How would you be doing that?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Go expenses.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Yep.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Then verify payment history.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Just verifying payment.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Just looking through.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Let's say you want to locate the expense for the garbage from the previous week.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Yep.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
So how would you be doing that?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I'd look through. I'd go into the past week section.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Then look and open it.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
There we go. That's all our garbage info.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Nice. Okay.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Now let's go back to the homepage again.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Going to the fourth task.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
The fourth task is just look at the insights feature for the rent category.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Is this still going to keep on recording while that's calling?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I don't know if it's going to keep on recording or not.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Sorry about that.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
The fourth task is just looking at the insights for the rent category

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
and just making sure you can see a visual representation for the rent category.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Okay, so I'm going to go to insights at the bottom.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And then there's rent. That's the amount.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And then at the top there's what percentage of it it is.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
And what if you want to go specifically and view the insights for rent itself?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Can I just click on it?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
There we go.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
That's our week's rent or our month's rent.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
That's nice. Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
And task five is just test the customizability.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
So test display accessibility features.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So how would you be doing that?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm going to click up here where I'm going to find, hopefully, settings or something.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Go in there, then app settings, then display settings.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Then display settings.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm going to change it to dark mode if that works.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Okay.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You actually coded that, don't you?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
So you can look at other features as well in the display settings.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
We've got contact, FAQs, managing categories.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm not sure what week start day does.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
That's fine.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Okay, so let's go back to the homepage again.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Genuine hope, sorry.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I believe it was light mode.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Right.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
So now your sixth task, which I believe it's the last task, it's test the help and support functionalities.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
So imagine you require some help with the app.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You want to look for some help within the app.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So what would you be doing in that case?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm going to go to the hamburger bar again.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
What do you actually call that?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I think it's a hamburger.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah, it is.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
It is called a hamburger.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Okay, I'm going to go help and support.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
No, I'm going to go app settings.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Okay.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
But we're going to assume that it did just take you there.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So I assume that just wasn't coded in.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Absolutely.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Then I'm going to look at the frequently asked questions.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And then here's some of my answers.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't know what I'm looking for, but I found it.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
That's nice.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Or I'm going to contact support and send them an email.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
How would you send them the email?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm going to put in my first name, Cassie.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
That's me.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
My email and my message.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
There we go.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Sweet.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Right.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
They'll get in contact with me.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Right.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So those were all the six tasks.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I hope you remember how to go back to the homepage.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Okay.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Okay, that's fine.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
That's fine.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yeah.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So how was your experience?

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Were there any sort of pain points or points you got confused?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I mean, there's a couple of buttons that sort of just don't work.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Can you remember which ones they were?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Like, like there.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Help and support.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Help and support.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That doesn't do anything.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
When you're, or some of the other ones.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I've now just forgotten them all.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, it's just a little bit funky how like when you're putting in text it just auto fills

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
it, but it's more of a like, like prototype type of thing.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It just doesn't have that functionality there.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Which one of the tasks do you think was the most like easiest, easiest to do?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Like intuitive to do?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Probably adding an expense.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Adding expense.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
It's just right there.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
And which one of them was more difficult to kind of understand and do?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Probably pay up because I could have gone in here.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Like I never even went into the screen.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
I just did it on the home screen, but I'm guessing that the functionality is essentially

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
the same.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
You can do it if you want.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I can just click pay and then pay for power.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
So it's sort of the exact same, but in a way it's good that there's multiple ways to do

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
it.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
That is one of the heuristics.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
That's nice.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
And then like, yeah, in this power screen, like only the bottom.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Only the bottom one actually works.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
Do you have any sort of like visual details or like anything you didn't quite like?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Regarding like the appearance or the colors used?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
The colors are fine.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
It's good to have like the, what should we call it?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Like all the display settings and stuff.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Damn.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm surprised you coded those.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
I only did one of mine.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
But yeah, so you can change the colors for like accessibility and all that.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
That's nice.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Okay.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So overall thoughts?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
It's pretty decent.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Right.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Especially for a prototype, like obviously some things would have to be like kind of

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
polished, but like that's sort of not what you're looking for, is it?

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
It's just, it does everything you need to.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
The only thing that it's obviously missing is, yeah, just like an easy way to add like

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
flatmates and stuff in, but that's more of a like setup type of thing than a day to day

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
thing.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Like we're kind of assuming this is already, you've been using it for a while, right?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
That makes sense.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yes.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
But you've got the setting there, so it's not like it's hard to find or anything.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Okay.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That makes it nice.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't know.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Right.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Thank you for that.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
Thank you for giving us your time and to test our prototype.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Thanks.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Thanks for joining us and hope you have a nice day.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Not like you won't be getting big in five minutes time.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Doing the exact same thing.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
That's exactly ten minutes.
