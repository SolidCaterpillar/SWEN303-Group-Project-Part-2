1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Awesome, now if we can just quickly get our names so Ricky, Ricky over there, Mazin, Alvean,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:20,800
and then Hugo, Paxton, Caillou, okay so question one, what were your first impressions of the

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
game?

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Yeah.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
It wasn't very pretty.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
It wasn't very pretty?

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
It didn't like colours.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
It didn't like colours.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Sorry.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Okay, that's fair.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
It's completely valid feedback.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Alright, so the colours in question, what did you like about them?

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Just a bit swampy.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Swampy?

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
A bit dark.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Okay.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Alright.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,440
I didn't notice the colours as much, I did think that the opening home page, there was

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
quite a lot going on.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
So overcrowded?

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,120
Yeah, more so that like there was a lot going on there so that limited the size that everything

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,400
could be to try and fit it onto the screen, so I feel like it could have benefited from

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,760
maybe prioritising some things, making a few things a little bit bigger, just so it was

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,320
kind of more obvious what was there rather than trying to just put all of it on there

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,800
kind of limited the way that the things could breathe and be a little bit more isolated.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,320
I probably would have focused on like one, either like your past expenses or like paying

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,800
new expenses instead of having them both on that screen.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,280
There's not too much going on.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,880
I did actually, I had a moment of confusion as to what pay up was, I was looking at it

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,360
thinking, am I paying there, who's paying here, is this shit that needs to be paid soon

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,000
or is this actually I can pay it right here?

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, that's good.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alright.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Did you find that the colour settings were any use of changing how you felt about the

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
whole swampy feel?

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Oh, that was just like accessibility stuff, so yeah, that was fine, that was good, I got

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
my problems there.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Did you like the alternatives colour scheme more or?

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
What was it?

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
The dark mode version?

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Yeah, yeah, that was good.

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I think the dark mode worked better with the greens and like blues that were on there.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
You felt the dark mode looked better with the greens and blues?

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I do like a dark mode though, so I might be biased, but yeah, I did like the other alternatives.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Alright, sweet.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Thank you very much.

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,840
We'll move on to the next question, assuming no one has any other first impressions of

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
the app that they want to share?

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
No.

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Awesome.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Second question.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Shoot, I'm pulling on the wrong questions, where did we actually put the actual, I'm

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
going to pause this for a second.

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah, awesome, thank you very much, good for catching that.

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:48,760
As I was saying, the next question is, describe your experience as you navigated the app,

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,760
so we're sort of taking a focus on navigation here, how you felt while you were going through,

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
that kind of thing.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Take a moment to think.

59
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,760
I don't know, I was a bit, it's pretty easy to get through the task, to be honest.

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Pretty easy?

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm just going to beg for forgiveness on Figma being Figma, so just try and take it

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
on how the design actually should have looked.

63
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,680
I thought the navigation was good with it, I liked the separation that you had into your

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
tabs at the bottom, I thought that was good.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,680
I thought the way that you implemented the swiping functionality was really cool.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,680
I thought that the splitting you did between the stuff that was in your three bar menu

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
and the stuff that was found elsewhere along the bottom and on the home screen, I thought

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
that was intuitive.

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
When asked to do a task that was like, oh, go into the settings or whatever, I was like,

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
okay, there's not a settings tab at the bottom, it'll be in the three bar menu.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, and it was there.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Agreed.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
I didn't really realise that swiping even existed.

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Oh, could you swipe across?

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Yeah.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Oh no, that was sick.

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
There was one where you could swipe down and the scrolling was good as well.

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Something came up and you could swipe it away, I thought that was weird.

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I thought the insights tab had a bit of an ambiguous name, it would have been better

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,520
to be like analysis or I don't know.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,520
So did that give you any confusion when you were going through?

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Well, I didn't really know that it was going to be charts and stuff.

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,520
I suppose the icon does say, or does show a chart, but you know, it almost would have

84
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,520
been better to have the insights on the home page instead of so much detail.

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Maybe, I don't know.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
What was the question again?

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,440
The question is about navigation, how did you feel about your experiences while navigating

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
it?

89
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,000
So the fact that you didn't notice there was swiping is a valid part of the navigation

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,440
thing, that is a valid thing to bring up.

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Any other comments on navigation?

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Navigation is pretty smooth.

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
I like it.

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,360
But just a little confusion on the pay up thing and on the insights being.

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,360
I didn't actually ever use the icon that's at the bottom that's for the pay one.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I never used it, I used the pay button that was on the home screen.

97
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,360
You pressed the pay button that was on the home screen rather than the one at the bottom.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I noticed it later when I was going to insights, I was like, does it actually do the same thing?

99
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I wasn't sure.

100
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,280
We'll go on to the next question then.

101
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,280
The next question which is, were there any parts of the app that you found confusing

102
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
or hard to use?

103
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Yeah, it was that.

104
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I mean it wasn't confusing but pay up on the front then pay up down the bottom.

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Upcoming payments and pay up are two separate things as well.

106
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,280
So upcoming payments and then pay up right below, you felt that was a bit confusing between

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
those two?

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Upcoming payment, why?

109
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Do you need me to slow down?

110
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
No.

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Is the upcoming payments, are they interactable there or is that purely informative?

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Like in your idea for the...

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
They should be.

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Click on the bottom.

115
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Let's just try the arrow.

116
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
It'll do something.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
The arrow, yes, the arrow will make it expand.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I don't think the individual groceries or like the individual things are.

119
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So you think it would have made sense for the...

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,120
When you're showing something that's in like upcoming payments, in my head I go, okay,

121
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
that's upcoming, I should deal with it right now.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I should click on it and then pay from it from there.

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Rather than having to go to a different area and then click that.

124
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,120
So you think that the upcoming payments, each payment should be clickable and should take

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
you to that payment?

126
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah, I feel like that would be, and it would even consolidate potentially some of the...

127
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I think it's supposed to work that way.

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I don't know if that's just Figma, I can't remember.

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
It could just be that it wasn't implemented.

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Even if it is meant to be done that way, it would have been good to have like some dots

131
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
or like a pencil or anything.

132
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
A pencil, something that indicates edit or click on it?

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah.

134
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay, yeah.

135
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
All right.

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
So you think that the editing stuff should...

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
For the payout, you wouldn't click on it, right?

138
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Like that doesn't...

139
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Doesn't seem to allow clicking right now.

140
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Whether that's supposed to happen or not, I can't remember.

141
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,960
But I'm supposed to go to pay when you do that.

142
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Yeah.

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Okay.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
So anything else then?

145
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Any other thoughts that you felt were confusing on how to use?

146
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,960
There was one part for me within the three bar menu.

147
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
The three bar menu?

148
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Let's bring that up real quick.

149
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Yeah.

150
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
There was the help and support tab there.

151
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960
But then there was also help and support within the app settings.

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
And my first reaction was to click that, which wasn't implemented.

153
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
And then I was like, oh, app settings, help and support.

154
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
So it felt like there was potentially two areas

155
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
where the help and support was going to be

156
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
that weren't going to lead to each other.

157
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Makes sense.

158
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
So you felt it was confusing to have a help and support section

159
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
in the hamburger menu and also any side of the app settings.

160
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Yeah.

161
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Okay, cool.

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
That's great feedback.

163
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Anyone else?

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Any other aspects that you felt were confusing or hard to use?

165
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,880
When I was doing it over there and I had to get the display settings up.

166
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Remember I didn't know which one to click?

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Yeah, that's a good point.

168
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
You went with how you weren't sure between household and app settings, yeah?

169
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
So I just went to app settings.

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
What would you say we could do better on that front?

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
What are these even in household settings?

172
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Oh, is that like the flat household?

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, okay.

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
So something that would have made it clear that the household was in a flat.

175
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Yeah, like manage household.

176
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Yeah, like manage household.

177
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Management or something.

178
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Okay.

179
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Because I don't know what you want to have with your app,

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,800
but to me managing what would be in a tab like that

181
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
is like managing the members that are in the household

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,720
or like the flat payments that you're having in there.

183
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,720
To me that's less of a setting and more of like a thing.

184
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
So settings perhaps is what kind of...

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah, settings to me is like app functionality,

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
which I don't quite think is up there.

187
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Awesome.

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
All right, anything else?

189
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Any other aspects you felt were confusing or hard to use?

190
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Nothing.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Sweet.

192
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Let's move on to the next question.

193
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,640
How did you feel about the color scheme of the app?

194
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
It's a swampy answer.

195
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
We've had one person talk about the swampy answer.

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Anyone have anything else?

197
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,640
We can bring up sort of the color scheme across different pages here.

198
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I don't mind the greens.

199
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
We'll just wait for the latte.

200
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So you don't like the greens?

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
No, I don't mind the greens.

202
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
You don't mind the greens?

203
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I don't mind like the way that you have the toning of the greens.

204
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
They've got the lighter one, and then they've got the even lighter one,

205
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
and then they've got the darker one.

206
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I think the color theory stuff that they've done is good.

207
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Okay.

208
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
They could have chosen some other colors.

209
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
But I don't dislike this color.

210
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
I would use it still.

211
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
But I acknowledge that there could be a better one.

212
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Okay, what other colors would you say are better than swampy green?

213
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I reckon it could have been better, but it's making all the icons white.

214
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
What's that?

215
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Making all the icons and text on the dark green and white.

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Making the icons on the dark green and white.

217
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,480
So right now we're seeing obviously that Payup and the hamburger

218
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
and the bottom bar are all in black.

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Or blue if that's the kind of selected one.

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,480
But you're saying those should be white to better contrast the dark green background?

221
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Yeah.

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Okay.

223
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,480
There is also on the homepage, there's the pay button that's on the green.

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,480
To me, I don't like the way that the blue interacts with the green there.

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I don't like how the blue pay button is on the light green.

226
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
That could just be...

227
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Feels too much of a contrast maybe?

228
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I think that blue is just a little bit darker.

229
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Too dark?

230
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Too dark.

231
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Because you've got a nice pastel kind of lightish green.

232
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
And you have like a navy heavy blue.

233
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
And you've got the darker green for your header and footer.

234
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
And then the navy is even darker.

235
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Which to me suggests that it's like...

236
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
The things that are in between the header and footer to me

237
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
should be lighter than the header and footer.

238
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Gotcha.

239
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Kind of like the borders.

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
That's very good feedback.

241
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
All right.

242
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
And then while we're on that subject, we may as well talk about the dark mode equivalent.

243
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
So let's jump over to app settings.

244
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Let's go to display settings.

245
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,320
And let's switch it over to dark mode.

246
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,320
So with that in mind, what are you guys thinking for the dark mode settings?

247
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
How does that look to you guys?

248
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Thoughts on the color scheme in dark mode?

249
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
See, I never went to here.

250
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I never went back.

251
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I can't lie.

252
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
That one I think someone might have messed up with using the right variables.

253
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Yeah, it is just a little bit dark.

254
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I don't mind the black background.

255
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,240
And I think it works kind of nicely with the lighter green for the header and footer.

256
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,240
I like that the text is now white and the icons are now white as well.

257
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Yeah.

258
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,240
With the dark mode, this should be like contrast.

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Like a lot of contrast.

260
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Yeah, I think it's just the colors for the bubbles and where it says broadband and stuff.

261
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
I can't see that it's separated.

262
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than the background.

263
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah.

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
You can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than this background.

265
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Like the color that is here is very similar to the black that's in the background where

266
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,080
it's kind of hard from the distance that I'm at of not even quite a meter, I can't tell

267
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
it apart.

268
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Okay.

269
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
All right.

270
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm just going to other pages sort of thing.

271
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Yeah.

272
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I think.

273
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes, no.

274
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
I mean, at least you've got the important information.

275
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
The blue button is a bit too much.

276
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
It's a little bit.

277
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,080
It definitely pops out as like an interactable button.

278
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Yeah.

279
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
But it doesn't look nice with the...

280
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
It doesn't quite work with it.

281
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Okay.

282
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,080
So in the payoff, the blue button, the pay buttons for each of these kind of stand out

283
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
too much.

284
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
They're like a little bit of an eyesore.

285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Yeah.

286
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It feels a bit disjointed from the other color scheme.

287
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Yeah.

288
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Yeah.

289
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Okay.

290
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
And then expenses.

291
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah.

292
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
This is also just like...

293
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Oh.

294
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Someone didn't use the right variables, I think.

295
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,080
So in the expenses future section, someone obviously might have made a mistake there.

296
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,080
But all right.

297
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Trumpage.

298
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
So yeah.

299
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
You can't read those.

300
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
You can't read those.

301
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
It's the dark text on the dark background as well.

302
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
The dark text on the dark background?

303
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
The text is white.

304
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
I could read it.

305
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
So on the home page in dark mode, the upcoming payments.

306
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Yeah.

307
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
The dark text on the green.

308
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Like the fact that the actual number for $100.

309
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I can read that.

310
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Perfect.

311
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah.

312
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
And I can read upcoming payments.

313
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
I just can't read what's below it.

314
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Makes sense.

315
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Because it's black on really dark color.

316
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Is it an accident or is it...

317
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
I'm pretty sure it's an accident.

318
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
Yeah.

319
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
But awesome.

320
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
All right.

321
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
We'll jump over to app settings.

322
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
See, actually this looks good.

323
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
This probably looks good.

324
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
You like how the app settings look like in dark mode?

325
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
It looks great in dark mode.

326
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Yeah.

327
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I do like that.

328
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
And then in light mode, do you think it looks all right?

329
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah.

330
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
It looks fine to me.

331
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Yeah.

332
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
It looks fine in dark mode.

333
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
All right.

334
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Sweet.

335
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
We'll move on to the next and final question.

336
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
If this were a real app, would you use it?

337
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Why or why not?

338
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
No.

339
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Probably not.

340
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
No.

341
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Probably not.

342
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Nah, dude.

343
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Sorry.

344
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
I mean, when you guys come to us, you cannot fucking slay us.

345
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Honestly, we want it.

346
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
No.

347
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Listen.

348
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
We want you to listen.

349
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
Going to the home page?

350
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Dark or light mode?

351
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Light mode.

352
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I think if I was using an app, I would want more visual representation.

353
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,080
You have your Insights tab, which has the pie chart and the graphs and stuff.

354
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,080
I'd want more of a focus on that kind of summative kind of visual.

355
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
So you want more insights?

356
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Even if it was more visual, more graphs?

357
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah.

358
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Something that I can see quickly and be like, oh, okay.

359
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Here's my summary.

360
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Here's my thing.

361
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
How about bar graphs?

362
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Bar graph?

363
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,080
I thought it was kind of funny with the rent that there was a bar graph because it's just

364
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
the same value the whole time.

365
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
That's fair.

366
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,080
I think that bar graphs, in terms of weekly representations, I think that's good.

367
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I think food is a better example, I think.

368
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah.

369
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I like that because it's a good way of tracking your history.

370
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,080
If there was some summative feature on the homepage or something.

371
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
On the homepage.

372
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Something that I open your app, I see it immediately.

373
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I don't need to go to the Insights tab.

374
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Some sort of indicator.

375
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,080
The same way we have a preview of expenses and a preview of payouts.

376
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,080
The homepage, to me, should have a summary of the app.

377
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,080
It should have, here are your most pressing payments, which you have with the upcoming payments.

378
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Here's what you need to pay.

379
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,080
And then here's a little summary of where you're at monetarily.

380
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,080
So what would you want on the homepage in terms of the insights?

381
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
What kind of insight would you want immediately in your face?

382
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Just kind of like the pie chart you have is good.

383
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Here's your little piece.

384
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
We cleaned total expenses.

385
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
I know, but we created something that I like.

386
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:24,080
The point to make is that you can use a calendar to just remind yourself when you need to pay bills.

387
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,080
So the app has to have some sort of functionality beyond that.

388
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,080
And if you want to manage your expenses, you want to see all of the money.

389
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Where it's going.

390
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
What is being spent on.

391
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,080
So when you say all of the money, are you referring to all of the money or all of the money related to the flat stuff?

392
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
All of the flat stuff.

393
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
How much is being paid to wear each week.

394
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Right. We're kind of getting a bit messy now.

395
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
We're questioning the value of the entire app.

396
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,080
That's fair. That's the point of the question.

397
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,080
So you wouldn't use this to manage flat expenses with other people?

398
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Probably not, dude.

399
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I can remember rent stealing on a Tuesday every week.

400
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,080
And I do it now with my own flat.

401
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,080
But if someone pays for, I don't know, say toiletries or something and they say,

402
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Oh yeah, chuck me like $20 for this.

403
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,080
You don't want that to be sort of built into the app?

404
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Or have an app for it?

405
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
I mean, yeah, but...

406
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Or do you reckon that's just not worth it?

407
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,080
You're just like, yeah, sure, they said $20, I'll give them $20, done.

408
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Well, I guess the point of that is to cater for that, right?

409
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I mean, in my current flat, I'm not doing that.

410
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
If someone buys toiletries, they say, send me $20, and I do it.

411
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
But the point of this app is to incorporate that, right?

412
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
So the idea behind the pay-ups.

413
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
We're somewhat in the market for an app of this type.

414
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Yeah, but go back to the main page.

415
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
The home page?

416
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah, the home page.

417
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,080
There's total owing, upcoming payments.

418
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
It doesn't say who's paid, or it doesn't pay up.

419
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,080
In pay-up, we do see the people who have paid certain expenses.

420
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Are those the people that have already paid?

421
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
I thought those were the things you had to pay.

422
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Well, the idea is someone has paid for it, and you have to pay them for it.

423
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Pay them back for it.

424
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Like, say, for example, Alex has paid for rent, and butter, and power.

425
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
And so now your job is to pay your share of that.

426
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
So I'd go over here, and I'd say, yep.

427
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I'd go to here, and I'd say, I want to pay $80.25 for his power.

428
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
And I pay for that.

429
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Or say that I paid for that.

430
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Those are bills that Alex has put up.

431
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Those are bills that Alex has paid for already.

432
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
That you need to pay your share for.

433
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
It's like if Alex goes and pays the rent, it's like, all right, cool.

434
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
I just paid $2,000 in rent.

435
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
You guys can each chuck me $500.

436
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,080
To be honest, I'd almost just scrap paying on the home screen.

437
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
I'd just make it so you could only pay here.

438
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,080
So you would not want to see things you need to pay still?

439
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
No, I'd want to see things.

440
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Isn't that up?

441
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Isn't that in the upcoming payments?

442
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Aren't they almost the same thing?

443
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,080
You're saying that upcoming payments and pay up are almost the same thing?

444
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I don't know.

445
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
What's the difference?

446
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Wouldn't you like to see what you need to pay?

447
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Sorry, let me rephrase.

448
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Upcoming payments is meant to represent expenses that nobody has paid yet.

449
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Things that will need to be paid.

450
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Whereas pay up is meant to be, you know, a flatmate has already paid for this.

451
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Now you need to pay them your share.

452
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Okay.

453
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
So the upcoming payments are assigned, are they?

454
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,080
The upcoming payments are sort of more like recurring things that need to happen over time.

455
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,080
It's dated to the whole flat, right?

456
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Everyone on the flat needs to pay groceries.

457
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,080
And then if you go down into pay up, Alex has already paid rent.

458
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,080
And you need to pay Alex back for what they paid for your section.

459
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Although in this case, that would be like rent for next month.

460
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Whereas that would be rent like for last month or whatever.

461
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
And you still have to pay him for last month.

462
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
But the idea is that rent is coming up again and someone needs to pay for that.

463
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Yep.

464
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
But you felt like that wasn't intuitive?

465
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
I feel like this whole sort of conversation has proven that.

466
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
That's fair.

467
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
If it's not intuitive enough, that's a glaring flaw.

468
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,080
It's hard to, because with the above section, the upcoming payments.

469
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
I feel like that might make more sense if it was stuff that was specific to the user, the current user.

470
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Because that seems like groceries is that $30 in total for the flat.

471
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Who's the person that's going to pay that?

472
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Do you then need to like talk outside of the app and be like, okay, I'll pay that and then you pay me back in the app.

473
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
Makes sense.

474
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,080
Whereas like you could potentially add in an expense and then assign that to one of the flat members.

475
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,080
And then you'd only see the ones that you needed to pay in that upcoming payment.

476
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Rather than everything.

477
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
So you would still want to merge the two then wouldn't you?

478
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Potentially no.

479
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,080
It's just more of like with the upcoming payments with like how I'm understanding it currently.

480
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Those are expenses for the flat in its entirety.

481
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Yes.

482
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Which means that like anyone who's in the flat could just pick one and pay it and pay it now.

483
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes.

484
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Because I feel like on like my home screen I'd want to see payments that are for me.

485
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Not like because I might not be paying the food.

486
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
So like I don't really need to be seeing that because that's not my responsibility at the moment.

487
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Whereas like I would want to see they're like, okay, I'm in charge of groceries this week.

488
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
There's my groceries payment.

489
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
And then I'd scroll down to pay up and I'd say, okay, they paid for the food this this week.

490
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Let me chuck it across.

491
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Okay.

492
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Awesome.

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
All right.

494
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Is there anything else they want to add?

495
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
I'd probably make this almost like a drop down.

496
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Like instead of upcoming payments being the total, just have it so like each individual upcoming payment.

497
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
You can see like, oh, John's paid this for it.

498
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
Bob's paid this.

499
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Oh, like the groceries.

500
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Yeah.

501
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
You drop down from the groceries and it'll tell you who's paying it or who's paying it.

502
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,080
So each item in upcoming payments you would say John has paid this much.

503
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Yeah.

504
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I mean, regardless, it is quite a lot of like space just for like text that doesn't really sort of do anything in a way.

505
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
In the middle of space you mean?

506
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Yeah.

507
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Like on your home screen, I feel like it should have some extra sort of functionality in a way.

508
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Okay.

509
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I've got a sort of just like pain in the ass thing, but probably just make the dates a bit bigger.

510
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
The dates?

511
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Oh yeah, that's fair.

512
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
I mean, to be fair, this is meant to be on a phone that's meant to be closer.

513
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Obviously I'm showing it to you on my laptop, but like it is meant to be like in your face

514
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,080
a little bit more, but yeah, I can see that it's pretty small.

515
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
That's it for me.

516
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
I got nothing else.

517
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Awesome.

518
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
No, no, awesome.

519
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
These are the kinds of things.

520
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
This is what I expect from you.

521
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
The more you give, the more I can cut away and leave the good parts.

522
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Absolutely.

523
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
We're trying to give you some issues.

524
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Be as nit-picky as you like.

525
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
The more issues you can solve, the better you're going to do on that part, right?

526
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Exactly, yeah.

527
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
So anyone got anything else they want to mention?

528
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
No?

529
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
No other overall feedback?

530
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Just like overall make summative information more accessible.

531
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Well not accessible information, more of a main sort of...

532
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Yeah, I feel like the app's pretty easy to use when you're like given the tasks that

533
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
you've got to do.

534
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
It's just when like, like here, we talk about the whole thing.

535
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
That sort of...

536
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Yeah, it's when you open it up and you have to figure it out yourself.

537
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Yeah, and you're sort of overthinking it in a way.

538
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I wasn't confused when I was using it at the start, but then...

539
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Awesome.

540
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Yeah, when you start to think about it, it's like, wait a minute.

541
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Yeah.

542
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Alright, we've given you 20 minutes where we are going.

543
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I think we should stop.

544
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Yeah, that's probably good enough.

545
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Awesome.

546
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Thank you very much.

547
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Amazing.

548
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Thank you.

549
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Bye.

550
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Bye.

551
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Bye.

552
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Bye.

553
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Bye.

554
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Bye.

555
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Bye.

556
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Bye.

557
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Bye.

558
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Bye.

559
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Bye.

560
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Bye.

561
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Bye.

562
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Bye.

563
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Bye.

564
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Bye.
