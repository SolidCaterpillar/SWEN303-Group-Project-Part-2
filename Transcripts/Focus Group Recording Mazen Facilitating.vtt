WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Awesome, now if we can just quickly get our names so Ricky, Ricky over there, Mazin, Alvean,

00:08.320 --> 00:20.800
and then Hugo, Paxton, Caillou, okay so question one, what were your first impressions of the

00:20.800 --> 00:21.800
game?

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
Yeah.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
It wasn't very pretty.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
It wasn't very pretty?

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
It didn't like colours.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.800
It didn't like colours.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.800
Sorry.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
Okay, that's fair.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.800
It's completely valid feedback.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.800
Alright, so the colours in question, what did you like about them?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.800
Just a bit swampy.

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
Swampy?

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
A bit dark.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
Okay.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
Alright.

00:39.800 --> 00:47.440
I didn't notice the colours as much, I did think that the opening home page, there was

00:47.440 --> 00:48.800
quite a lot going on.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
So overcrowded?

00:49.800 --> 00:56.120
Yeah, more so that like there was a lot going on there so that limited the size that everything

00:56.120 --> 01:01.400
could be to try and fit it onto the screen, so I feel like it could have benefited from

01:01.400 --> 01:05.760
maybe prioritising some things, making a few things a little bit bigger, just so it was

01:05.760 --> 01:11.320
kind of more obvious what was there rather than trying to just put all of it on there

01:11.320 --> 01:16.800
kind of limited the way that the things could breathe and be a little bit more isolated.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.320
I probably would have focused on like one, either like your past expenses or like paying

01:23.320 --> 01:26.800
new expenses instead of having them both on that screen.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.280
There's not too much going on.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.880
I did actually, I had a moment of confusion as to what pay up was, I was looking at it

01:34.880 --> 01:40.360
thinking, am I paying there, who's paying here, is this shit that needs to be paid soon

01:40.360 --> 01:43.000
or is this actually I can pay it right here?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay, that's good.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Alright.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.400
Did you find that the colour settings were any use of changing how you felt about the

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
whole swampy feel?

01:50.400 --> 01:54.920
Oh, that was just like accessibility stuff, so yeah, that was fine, that was good, I got

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
my problems there.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.920
Did you like the alternatives colour scheme more or?

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
What was it?

01:58.920 --> 01:59.920
The dark mode version?

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Yeah, yeah, that was good.

02:00.920 --> 02:06.920
I think the dark mode worked better with the greens and like blues that were on there.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.920
You felt the dark mode looked better with the greens and blues?

02:08.920 --> 02:14.920
I do like a dark mode though, so I might be biased, but yeah, I did like the other alternatives.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
Alright, sweet.

02:16.840 --> 02:17.840
Thank you very much.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.840
We'll move on to the next question, assuming no one has any other first impressions of

02:22.840 --> 02:24.840
the app that they want to share?

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
No.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
Awesome.

02:26.840 --> 02:27.840
Second question.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.840
Shoot, I'm pulling on the wrong questions, where did we actually put the actual, I'm

02:33.840 --> 02:35.840
going to pause this for a second.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.840
Yeah, awesome, thank you very much, good for catching that.

02:38.760 --> 02:48.760
As I was saying, the next question is, describe your experience as you navigated the app,

02:48.760 --> 02:52.760
so we're sort of taking a focus on navigation here, how you felt while you were going through,

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
that kind of thing.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
Take a moment to think.

02:54.760 --> 03:02.760
I don't know, I was a bit, it's pretty easy to get through the task, to be honest.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.760
Pretty easy?

03:04.680 --> 03:08.680
I'm just going to beg for forgiveness on Figma being Figma, so just try and take it

03:08.680 --> 03:11.680
on how the design actually should have looked.

03:11.680 --> 03:16.680
I thought the navigation was good with it, I liked the separation that you had into your

03:16.680 --> 03:19.680
tabs at the bottom, I thought that was good.

03:19.680 --> 03:25.680
I thought the way that you implemented the swiping functionality was really cool.

03:25.680 --> 03:32.680
I thought that the splitting you did between the stuff that was in your three bar menu

03:33.600 --> 03:37.600
and the stuff that was found elsewhere along the bottom and on the home screen, I thought

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
that was intuitive.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.600
When asked to do a task that was like, oh, go into the settings or whatever, I was like,

03:42.600 --> 03:45.600
okay, there's not a settings tab at the bottom, it'll be in the three bar menu.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
Yeah, and it was there.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.600
Agreed.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.600
I didn't really realise that swiping even existed.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
Oh, could you swipe across?

03:53.600 --> 03:54.600
Yeah.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Oh no, that was sick.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.600
There was one where you could swipe down and the scrolling was good as well.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.600
Something came up and you could swipe it away, I thought that was weird.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.520
I thought the insights tab had a bit of an ambiguous name, it would have been better

04:06.520 --> 04:09.520
to be like analysis or I don't know.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.520
So did that give you any confusion when you were going through?

04:12.520 --> 04:15.520
Well, I didn't really know that it was going to be charts and stuff.

04:15.520 --> 04:22.520
I suppose the icon does say, or does show a chart, but you know, it almost would have

04:22.520 --> 04:28.520
been better to have the insights on the home page instead of so much detail.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.520
Maybe, I don't know.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.440
What was the question again?

04:34.440 --> 04:38.440
The question is about navigation, how did you feel about your experiences while navigating

04:38.440 --> 04:39.440
it?

04:39.440 --> 04:44.000
So the fact that you didn't notice there was swiping is a valid part of the navigation

04:44.000 --> 04:48.440
thing, that is a valid thing to bring up.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.440
Any other comments on navigation?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.360
Navigation is pretty smooth.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
I like it.

05:04.360 --> 05:09.360
But just a little confusion on the pay up thing and on the insights being.

05:09.360 --> 05:16.360
I didn't actually ever use the icon that's at the bottom that's for the pay one.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.360
I never used it, I used the pay button that was on the home screen.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.360
You pressed the pay button that was on the home screen rather than the one at the bottom.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.360
I noticed it later when I was going to insights, I was like, does it actually do the same thing?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.360
I wasn't sure.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.280
We'll go on to the next question then.

05:32.280 --> 05:38.280
The next question which is, were there any parts of the app that you found confusing

05:38.280 --> 05:41.280
or hard to use?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.280
Yeah, it was that.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.280
I mean it wasn't confusing but pay up on the front then pay up down the bottom.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.280
Upcoming payments and pay up are two separate things as well.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.280
So upcoming payments and then pay up right below, you felt that was a bit confusing between

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
those two?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.280
Upcoming payment, why?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
Do you need me to slow down?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
No.

06:01.200 --> 06:07.200
Is the upcoming payments, are they interactable there or is that purely informative?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.200
Like in your idea for the...

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
They should be.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
Click on the bottom.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.200
Let's just try the arrow.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
It'll do something.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.200
The arrow, yes, the arrow will make it expand.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.200
I don't think the individual groceries or like the individual things are.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.200
So you think it would have made sense for the...

06:26.120 --> 06:30.120
When you're showing something that's in like upcoming payments, in my head I go, okay,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.120
that's upcoming, I should deal with it right now.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.120
I should click on it and then pay from it from there.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.120
Rather than having to go to a different area and then click that.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.120
So you think that the upcoming payments, each payment should be clickable and should take

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
you to that payment?

06:43.120 --> 06:47.120
Yeah, I feel like that would be, and it would even consolidate potentially some of the...

06:47.120 --> 06:49.120
I think it's supposed to work that way.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
I don't know if that's just Figma, I can't remember.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.120
It could just be that it wasn't implemented.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.040
Even if it is meant to be done that way, it would have been good to have like some dots

06:59.040 --> 07:02.040
or like a pencil or anything.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.040
A pencil, something that indicates edit or click on it?

07:06.040 --> 07:07.040
Yeah.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
Okay, yeah.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
All right.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
So you think that the editing stuff should...

07:11.040 --> 07:14.040
For the payout, you wouldn't click on it, right?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.040
Like that doesn't...

07:16.040 --> 07:19.040
Doesn't seem to allow clicking right now.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
Whether that's supposed to happen or not, I can't remember.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.960
But I'm supposed to go to pay when you do that.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.960
Yeah.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.960
Okay.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
So anything else then?

07:28.960 --> 07:31.960
Any other thoughts that you felt were confusing on how to use?

07:31.960 --> 07:35.960
There was one part for me within the three bar menu.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
The three bar menu?

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
Let's bring that up real quick.

07:37.960 --> 07:38.960
Yeah.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.960
There was the help and support tab there.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.960
But then there was also help and support within the app settings.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.960
And my first reaction was to click that, which wasn't implemented.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.880
And then I was like, oh, app settings, help and support.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.880
So it felt like there was potentially two areas

07:52.880 --> 07:54.880
where the help and support was going to be

07:54.880 --> 07:56.880
that weren't going to lead to each other.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.880
Makes sense.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.880
So you felt it was confusing to have a help and support section

07:59.880 --> 08:02.880
in the hamburger menu and also any side of the app settings.

08:02.880 --> 08:03.880
Yeah.

08:03.880 --> 08:04.880
Okay, cool.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
That's great feedback.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.880
Anyone else?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
Any other aspects that you felt were confusing or hard to use?

08:08.880 --> 08:13.880
When I was doing it over there and I had to get the display settings up.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.880
Remember I didn't know which one to click?

08:15.880 --> 08:16.880
Yeah, that's a good point.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.800
You went with how you weren't sure between household and app settings, yeah?

08:20.800 --> 08:21.800
So I just went to app settings.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.800
What would you say we could do better on that front?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.800
What are these even in household settings?

08:26.800 --> 08:28.800
Oh, is that like the flat household?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
Oh, okay.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.800
So something that would have made it clear that the household was in a flat.

08:32.800 --> 08:33.800
Yeah, like manage household.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800
Yeah, like manage household.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
Management or something.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
Okay.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.800
Because I don't know what you want to have with your app,

08:41.800 --> 08:46.800
but to me managing what would be in a tab like that

08:47.720 --> 08:49.720
is like managing the members that are in the household

08:49.720 --> 08:54.720
or like the flat payments that you're having in there.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.720
To me that's less of a setting and more of like a thing.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.720
So settings perhaps is what kind of...

09:01.720 --> 09:06.720
Yeah, settings to me is like app functionality,

09:06.720 --> 09:08.720
which I don't quite think is up there.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
Awesome.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
All right, anything else?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
Any other aspects you felt were confusing or hard to use?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.720
Nothing.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
Sweet.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
Let's move on to the next question.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.640
How did you feel about the color scheme of the app?

09:21.640 --> 09:24.640
It's a swampy answer.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.640
We've had one person talk about the swampy answer.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.640
Anyone have anything else?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.640
We can bring up sort of the color scheme across different pages here.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.640
I don't mind the greens.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.640
We'll just wait for the latte.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.640
So you don't like the greens?

09:36.640 --> 09:37.640
No, I don't mind the greens.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.640
You don't mind the greens?

09:38.640 --> 09:42.640
I don't mind like the way that you have the toning of the greens.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.560
They've got the lighter one, and then they've got the even lighter one,

09:45.560 --> 09:47.560
and then they've got the darker one.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.560
I think the color theory stuff that they've done is good.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.560
Okay.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.560
They could have chosen some other colors.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.560
But I don't dislike this color.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.560
I would use it still.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.560
But I acknowledge that there could be a better one.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.560
Okay, what other colors would you say are better than swampy green?

10:03.560 --> 10:07.560
I reckon it could have been better, but it's making all the icons white.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
What's that?

10:08.560 --> 10:11.560
Making all the icons and text on the dark green and white.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.480
Making the icons on the dark green and white.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.480
So right now we're seeing obviously that Payup and the hamburger

10:17.480 --> 10:20.480
and the bottom bar are all in black.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.480
Or blue if that's the kind of selected one.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.480
But you're saying those should be white to better contrast the dark green background?

10:27.480 --> 10:28.480
Yeah.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.480
Okay.

10:29.480 --> 10:34.480
There is also on the homepage, there's the pay button that's on the green.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.480
To me, I don't like the way that the blue interacts with the green there.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.400
I don't like how the blue pay button is on the light green.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
That could just be...

10:44.400 --> 10:46.400
Feels too much of a contrast maybe?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
I think that blue is just a little bit darker.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
Too dark?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
Too dark.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
Because you've got a nice pastel kind of lightish green.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
And you have like a navy heavy blue.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.400
And you've got the darker green for your header and footer.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
And then the navy is even darker.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.400
Which to me suggests that it's like...

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
The things that are in between the header and footer to me

11:05.400 --> 11:07.400
should be lighter than the header and footer.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
Gotcha.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
Kind of like the borders.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
That's very good feedback.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
All right.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.320
And then while we're on that subject, we may as well talk about the dark mode equivalent.

11:16.320 --> 11:20.320
So let's jump over to app settings.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.320
Let's go to display settings.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.320
And let's switch it over to dark mode.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.320
So with that in mind, what are you guys thinking for the dark mode settings?

11:31.320 --> 11:33.320
How does that look to you guys?

11:33.320 --> 11:36.320
Thoughts on the color scheme in dark mode?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.240
See, I never went to here.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.240
I never went back.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
I can't lie.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.240
That one I think someone might have messed up with using the right variables.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
Yeah, it is just a little bit dark.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.240
I don't mind the black background.

11:50.240 --> 11:57.240
And I think it works kind of nicely with the lighter green for the header and footer.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.240
I like that the text is now white and the icons are now white as well.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.240
Yeah.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.240
With the dark mode, this should be like contrast.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
Like a lot of contrast.

12:07.160 --> 12:15.160
Yeah, I think it's just the colors for the bubbles and where it says broadband and stuff.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.160
I can't see that it's separated.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.160
I can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than the background.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.160
Yeah.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
You can't differentiate that that's on a different layer than this background.

12:26.160 --> 12:31.160
Like the color that is here is very similar to the black that's in the background where

12:32.080 --> 12:36.080
it's kind of hard from the distance that I'm at of not even quite a meter, I can't tell

12:36.080 --> 12:37.080
it apart.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.080
Okay.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.080
All right.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.080
I'm just going to other pages sort of thing.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.080
Yeah.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
I think.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.080
Yes, no.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
I mean, at least you've got the important information.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.080
The blue button is a bit too much.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
It's a little bit.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.080
It definitely pops out as like an interactable button.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
Yeah.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
But it doesn't look nice with the...

12:54.080 --> 12:56.080
It doesn't quite work with it.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
Okay.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.080
So in the payoff, the blue button, the pay buttons for each of these kind of stand out

13:01.080 --> 13:02.080
too much.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
They're like a little bit of an eyesore.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.080
Yeah.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.080
It feels a bit disjointed from the other color scheme.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.080
Yeah.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.080
Yeah.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
Okay.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.080
And then expenses.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
Yeah.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.080
This is also just like...

13:13.080 --> 13:14.080
Oh.

13:14.080 --> 13:18.080
Someone didn't use the right variables, I think.

13:18.080 --> 13:23.080
So in the expenses future section, someone obviously might have made a mistake there.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.080
But all right.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.080
Trumpage.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
So yeah.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.080
You can't read those.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.080
You can't read those.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.080
It's the dark text on the dark background as well.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
The dark text on the dark background?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
The text is white.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.080
I could read it.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.080
So on the home page in dark mode, the upcoming payments.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
Yeah.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
The dark text on the green.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.080
Like the fact that the actual number for $100.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.080
I can read that.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.080
Perfect.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.080
Yeah.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.080
And I can read upcoming payments.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.080
I just can't read what's below it.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.080
Makes sense.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.080
Because it's black on really dark color.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.080
Is it an accident or is it...

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
I'm pretty sure it's an accident.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
Yeah.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.080
But awesome.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
All right.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.080
We'll jump over to app settings.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.080
See, actually this looks good.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.080
This probably looks good.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.080
You like how the app settings look like in dark mode?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.080
It looks great in dark mode.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
Yeah.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
I do like that.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
And then in light mode, do you think it looks all right?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
Yeah.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
It looks fine to me.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Yeah.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
It looks fine in dark mode.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.080
All right.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.080
Sweet.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080
We'll move on to the next and final question.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.080
If this were a real app, would you use it?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
Why or why not?

14:15.080 --> 14:16.080
No.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
Probably not.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.080
No.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.080
Probably not.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.080
Nah, dude.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
Sorry.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.080
I mean, when you guys come to us, you cannot fucking slay us.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.080
Honestly, we want it.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.080
No.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.080
Listen.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.080
We want you to listen.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.080
Going to the home page?

14:29.080 --> 14:30.080
Dark or light mode?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.080
Light mode.

14:31.080 --> 14:38.080
I think if I was using an app, I would want more visual representation.

14:38.080 --> 14:45.080
You have your Insights tab, which has the pie chart and the graphs and stuff.

14:45.080 --> 14:50.080
I'd want more of a focus on that kind of summative kind of visual.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.080
So you want more insights?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.080
Even if it was more visual, more graphs?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.080
Yeah.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.080
Something that I can see quickly and be like, oh, okay.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.080
Here's my summary.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.080
Here's my thing.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.080
How about bar graphs?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.080
Bar graph?

15:02.080 --> 15:05.080
I thought it was kind of funny with the rent that there was a bar graph because it's just

15:05.080 --> 15:07.080
the same value the whole time.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.080
That's fair.

15:08.080 --> 15:13.080
I think that bar graphs, in terms of weekly representations, I think that's good.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.080
I think food is a better example, I think.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.080
Yeah.

15:16.080 --> 15:22.080
I like that because it's a good way of tracking your history.

15:23.080 --> 15:28.080
If there was some summative feature on the homepage or something.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
On the homepage.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.080
Something that I open your app, I see it immediately.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.080
I don't need to go to the Insights tab.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.080
Some sort of indicator.

15:36.080 --> 15:42.080
The same way we have a preview of expenses and a preview of payouts.

15:42.080 --> 15:48.080
The homepage, to me, should have a summary of the app.

15:48.080 --> 15:53.080
It should have, here are your most pressing payments, which you have with the upcoming payments.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.080
Here's what you need to pay.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.080
And then here's a little summary of where you're at monetarily.

15:59.080 --> 16:03.080
So what would you want on the homepage in terms of the insights?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.080
What kind of insight would you want immediately in your face?

16:05.080 --> 16:10.080
Just kind of like the pie chart you have is good.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.080
Here's your little piece.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.080
We cleaned total expenses.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
I know, but we created something that I like.

16:17.080 --> 16:24.080
The point to make is that you can use a calendar to just remind yourself when you need to pay bills.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.080
So the app has to have some sort of functionality beyond that.

16:28.080 --> 16:32.080
And if you want to manage your expenses, you want to see all of the money.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
Where it's going.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.080
What is being spent on.

16:35.080 --> 16:40.080
So when you say all of the money, are you referring to all of the money or all of the money related to the flat stuff?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.080
All of the flat stuff.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
How much is being paid to wear each week.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.080
Right. We're kind of getting a bit messy now.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.080
We're questioning the value of the entire app.

16:49.080 --> 16:52.080
That's fair. That's the point of the question.

16:52.080 --> 16:57.080
So you wouldn't use this to manage flat expenses with other people?

16:57.080 --> 16:59.080
Probably not, dude.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.080
I can remember rent stealing on a Tuesday every week.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.080
And I do it now with my own flat.

17:05.080 --> 17:09.080
But if someone pays for, I don't know, say toiletries or something and they say,

17:09.080 --> 17:11.080
Oh yeah, chuck me like $20 for this.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.080
You don't want that to be sort of built into the app?

17:14.080 --> 17:16.080
Or have an app for it?

17:16.080 --> 17:18.080
I mean, yeah, but...

17:18.080 --> 17:20.080
Or do you reckon that's just not worth it?

17:20.080 --> 17:23.080
You're just like, yeah, sure, they said $20, I'll give them $20, done.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.080
Well, I guess the point of that is to cater for that, right?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.080
I mean, in my current flat, I'm not doing that.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.080
If someone buys toiletries, they say, send me $20, and I do it.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.080
But the point of this app is to incorporate that, right?

17:35.080 --> 17:37.080
So the idea behind the pay-ups.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.080
We're somewhat in the market for an app of this type.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.080
Yeah, but go back to the main page.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.080
The home page?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
Yeah, the home page.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.080
There's total owing, upcoming payments.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.080
It doesn't say who's paid, or it doesn't pay up.

17:53.080 --> 17:57.080
In pay-up, we do see the people who have paid certain expenses.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.080
Are those the people that have already paid?

18:00.080 --> 18:04.080
I thought those were the things you had to pay.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.080
Well, the idea is someone has paid for it, and you have to pay them for it.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.080
Pay them back for it.

18:10.080 --> 18:16.080
Like, say, for example, Alex has paid for rent, and butter, and power.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.080
And so now your job is to pay your share of that.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.080
So I'd go over here, and I'd say, yep.

18:21.080 --> 18:26.080
I'd go to here, and I'd say, I want to pay $80.25 for his power.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.080
And I pay for that.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
Or say that I paid for that.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
Those are bills that Alex has put up.

18:32.080 --> 18:36.080
Those are bills that Alex has paid for already.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
That you need to pay your share for.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.080
It's like if Alex goes and pays the rent, it's like, all right, cool.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
I just paid $2,000 in rent.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.080
You guys can each chuck me $500.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.080
To be honest, I'd almost just scrap paying on the home screen.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.080
I'd just make it so you could only pay here.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.080
So you would not want to see things you need to pay still?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.080
No, I'd want to see things.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
Isn't that up?

18:58.080 --> 19:00.080
Isn't that in the upcoming payments?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
Aren't they almost the same thing?

19:01.080 --> 19:05.080
You're saying that upcoming payments and pay up are almost the same thing?

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
I don't know.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
What's the difference?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.080
Wouldn't you like to see what you need to pay?

19:09.080 --> 19:12.080
Sorry, let me rephrase.

19:12.080 --> 19:16.080
Upcoming payments is meant to represent expenses that nobody has paid yet.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.080
Things that will need to be paid.

19:18.080 --> 19:25.080
Whereas pay up is meant to be, you know, a flatmate has already paid for this.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.080
Now you need to pay them your share.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.080
Okay.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.080
So the upcoming payments are assigned, are they?

19:31.080 --> 19:36.080
The upcoming payments are sort of more like recurring things that need to happen over time.

19:36.080 --> 19:40.080
It's dated to the whole flat, right?

19:40.080 --> 19:43.080
Everyone on the flat needs to pay groceries.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.080
And then if you go down into pay up, Alex has already paid rent.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.080
And you need to pay Alex back for what they paid for your section.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.080
Although in this case, that would be like rent for next month.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.080
Whereas that would be rent like for last month or whatever.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.080
And you still have to pay him for last month.

19:58.080 --> 20:02.080
But the idea is that rent is coming up again and someone needs to pay for that.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.080
Yep.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.080
But you felt like that wasn't intuitive?

20:05.080 --> 20:09.080
I feel like this whole sort of conversation has proven that.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.080
That's fair.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.080
If it's not intuitive enough, that's a glaring flaw.

20:12.080 --> 20:17.080
It's hard to, because with the above section, the upcoming payments.

20:17.080 --> 20:24.080
I feel like that might make more sense if it was stuff that was specific to the user, the current user.

20:24.080 --> 20:28.080
Because that seems like groceries is that $30 in total for the flat.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
Who's the person that's going to pay that?

20:30.080 --> 20:36.080
Do you then need to like talk outside of the app and be like, okay, I'll pay that and then you pay me back in the app.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
Makes sense.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.080
Whereas like you could potentially add in an expense and then assign that to one of the flat members.

20:41.080 --> 20:45.080
And then you'd only see the ones that you needed to pay in that upcoming payment.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
Rather than everything.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.080
So you would still want to merge the two then wouldn't you?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.080
Potentially no.

20:51.080 --> 20:56.080
It's just more of like with the upcoming payments with like how I'm understanding it currently.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.080
Those are expenses for the flat in its entirety.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
Yes.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.080
Which means that like anyone who's in the flat could just pick one and pay it and pay it now.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
Yes.

21:06.080 --> 21:12.080
Because I feel like on like my home screen I'd want to see payments that are for me.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.080
Not like because I might not be paying the food.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.080
So like I don't really need to be seeing that because that's not my responsibility at the moment.

21:19.080 --> 21:24.080
Whereas like I would want to see they're like, okay, I'm in charge of groceries this week.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.080
There's my groceries payment.

21:26.080 --> 21:30.080
And then I'd scroll down to pay up and I'd say, okay, they paid for the food this this week.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
Let me chuck it across.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.080
Okay.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.080
Awesome.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
All right.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.080
Is there anything else they want to add?

21:37.080 --> 21:39.080
I'd probably make this almost like a drop down.

21:39.080 --> 21:46.080
Like instead of upcoming payments being the total, just have it so like each individual upcoming payment.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.080
You can see like, oh, John's paid this for it.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
Bob's paid this.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
Oh, like the groceries.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
Yeah.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.080
You drop down from the groceries and it'll tell you who's paying it or who's paying it.

21:54.080 --> 22:00.080
So each item in upcoming payments you would say John has paid this much.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.080
Yeah.

22:01.080 --> 22:07.080
I mean, regardless, it is quite a lot of like space just for like text that doesn't really sort of do anything in a way.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.080
In the middle of space you mean?

22:08.080 --> 22:09.080
Yeah.

22:09.080 --> 22:14.080
Like on your home screen, I feel like it should have some extra sort of functionality in a way.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
Okay.

22:15.080 --> 22:19.080
I've got a sort of just like pain in the ass thing, but probably just make the dates a bit bigger.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
The dates?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Oh yeah, that's fair.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.080
I mean, to be fair, this is meant to be on a phone that's meant to be closer.

22:24.080 --> 22:28.080
Obviously I'm showing it to you on my laptop, but like it is meant to be like in your face

22:28.080 --> 22:32.080
a little bit more, but yeah, I can see that it's pretty small.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.080
That's it for me.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.080
I got nothing else.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.080
Awesome.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
No, no, awesome.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.080
These are the kinds of things.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.080
This is what I expect from you.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.080
The more you give, the more I can cut away and leave the good parts.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
Absolutely.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.080
We're trying to give you some issues.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.080
Be as nit-picky as you like.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.080
The more issues you can solve, the better you're going to do on that part, right?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.080
Exactly, yeah.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.080
So anyone got anything else they want to mention?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
No?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
No other overall feedback?

22:57.080 --> 23:01.080
Just like overall make summative information more accessible.

23:01.080 --> 23:06.080
Well not accessible information, more of a main sort of...

23:06.080 --> 23:11.080
Yeah, I feel like the app's pretty easy to use when you're like given the tasks that

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
you've got to do.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.080
It's just when like, like here, we talk about the whole thing.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
That sort of...

23:16.080 --> 23:18.080
Yeah, it's when you open it up and you have to figure it out yourself.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
Yeah, and you're sort of overthinking it in a way.

23:21.080 --> 23:26.080
I wasn't confused when I was using it at the start, but then...

23:26.080 --> 23:27.080
Awesome.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.080
Yeah, when you start to think about it, it's like, wait a minute.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.080
Yeah.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.080
Alright, we've given you 20 minutes where we are going.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.080
I think we should stop.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.080
Yeah, that's probably good enough.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.080
Awesome.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.080
Thank you very much.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.080
Amazing.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.080
Thank you.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.080
Bye.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
Bye.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.080
Bye.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
Bye.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.080
Bye.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.080
Bye.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
Bye.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.080
Bye.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.080
Bye.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.080
Bye.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.080
Bye.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.080
Bye.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.080
Bye.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
Bye.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Bye.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.080
Bye.
