1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, and we can also screen card all the phones to see where they're testing and stuff.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fuck, that's not a bad idea.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you guys just doing it on your laptop?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't know, yeah, that was our plan.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I mean, you can just download the Figma app.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Just download the Figma app, as long as you have the flows.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Screen recording's good.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It doesn't really matter too much for usability.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You have to record that.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For the testing, you can see how long it takes for each one.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I suppose you can record on the laptop as well.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, I'm not using my laptop, I'm using my phone.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, yeah, you can use that.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, officially we're going to start now.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, welcome to this testing, I guess.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to be testing our prototype, which is for a Flatmates Expense app.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Really?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, it is.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, just go through the app.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to be giving you some tasks which you have to go through and try and complete them.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Make sure you say what you're thinking and just go through your step, take your time.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But just make sure you can tell me what you're thinking about in each step.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Right, so I'm assuming you filled the consent form earlier, so that's all good.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And we will be recording the voice and also your inputs, I guess, for this test for future use.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But we will be leaving the data after the assignment is done, so that's all that.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, I'm just going to be setting this up.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's just going to take a minute.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's all good, just keep recording.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We're just bashing you.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, okay, that's fine.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, that's why we are here.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I would go for the seat form.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, I was confused for a second.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And the screen recording will also record your voice and the things you answer.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's pretty cool, Figma, because that's how it looks.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, so I'm going to be starting the recording now, and I'm going to hand you the phone.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, this is the testing we're just going to start, and your first task will be verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, you'll be adding a new recurring expense and verifying that it has actually been added.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And when adding the recurring expense, you'll be splitting it among household members.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, so I'm clicking add expense, because that's like the standard Google thing.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm just making this up, right?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Read.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Category.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What did you say it was again?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Just any expense.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
1,200? I don't think any of ours work in that way either.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There we go, there's our date done.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And repeat. Did you say how often?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It doesn't say how often, but just choose your favorite.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Every week. I'm going to split it with Sam and Alex and me.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My description.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Whatever it says for me.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going to click create.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sweet.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then I'm done.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to go into expenses and look at future expenses.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And then, I can't remember what I even set it to.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just verify it's been added, I guess.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What was it? 1,200 or something.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I assume it would be there.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, that's fine.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's the first task which is done, so let's just go back to the homepage.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The next task is to ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense and removing it from the list.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Basically, there's going to be an existing expense which you already paid, but you're going to be paying up the expense to another person.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just making sure it's already been done.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What would you be doing in this case?

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I assume these are my most recent expenses, so I'll go pay up.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then I'll pay Alex back for his rent.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll click pay.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What is it? Just the bottom one that works. Pay.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then I'm paying for power.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yep.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then what was the last bit?

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Just make sure it's been removed.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's been removed?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yep.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, I'd just look in there.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, that's nice.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Then go back to the homepage.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your third task is just view the past expenses and verify the payment history.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How would you be doing that?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go expenses.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yep.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then verify payment history.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just verifying payment.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Just looking through.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's say you want to locate the expense for the garbage from the previous week.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yep.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So how would you be doing that?

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'd look through. I'd go into the past week section.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then look and open it.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There we go. That's all our garbage info.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Nice. Okay.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now let's go back to the homepage again.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Going to the fourth task.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The fourth task is just look at the insights feature for the rent category.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is this still going to keep on recording while that's calling?

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know if it's going to keep on recording or not.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sorry about that.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The fourth task is just looking at the insights for the rent category

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and just making sure you can see a visual representation for the rent category.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so I'm going to go to insights at the bottom.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And then there's rent. That's the amount.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And then at the top there's what percentage of it it is.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And what if you want to go specifically and view the insights for rent itself?

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Can I just click on it?

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There we go.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's our week's rent or our month's rent.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's nice. Okay.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And task five is just test the customizability.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So test display accessibility features.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So how would you be doing that?

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to click up here where I'm going to find, hopefully, settings or something.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Go in there, then app settings, then display settings.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then display settings.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going to change it to dark mode if that works.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You actually coded that, don't you?

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So you can look at other features as well in the display settings.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We've got contact, FAQs, managing categories.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not sure what week start day does.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's fine.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, so let's go back to the homepage again.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Genuine hope, sorry.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I believe it was light mode.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So now your sixth task, which I believe it's the last task, it's test the help and support functionalities.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So imagine you require some help with the app.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You want to look for some help within the app.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So what would you be doing in that case?

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm going to go to the hamburger bar again.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What do you actually call that?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think it's a hamburger.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, it is.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It is called a hamburger.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, I'm going to go help and support.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, I'm going to go app settings.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But we're going to assume that it did just take you there.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I assume that just wasn't coded in.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Absolutely.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then I'm going to look at the frequently asked questions.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And then here's some of my answers.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know what I'm looking for, but I found it.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's nice.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or I'm going to contact support and send them an email.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How would you send them the email?

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm going to put in my first name, Cassie.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's me.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My email and my message.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There we go.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Sweet.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They'll get in contact with me.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So those were all the six tasks.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I hope you remember how to go back to the homepage.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay, that's fine.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's fine.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So how was your experience?

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Were there any sort of pain points or points you got confused?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean, there's a couple of buttons that sort of just don't work.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can you remember which ones they were?

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like, like there.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Help and support.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Help and support.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That doesn't do anything.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When you're, or some of the other ones.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I've now just forgotten them all.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, it's just a little bit funky how like when you're putting in text it just auto fills

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it, but it's more of a like, like prototype type of thing.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It just doesn't have that functionality there.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Which one of the tasks do you think was the most like easiest, easiest to do?

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like intuitive to do?

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Probably adding an expense.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Adding expense.

192
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's just right there.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And which one of them was more difficult to kind of understand and do?

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Probably pay up because I could have gone in here.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like I never even went into the screen.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just did it on the home screen, but I'm guessing that the functionality is essentially

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the same.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can do it if you want.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can just click pay and then pay for power.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So it's sort of the exact same, but in a way it's good that there's multiple ways to do

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
it.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That is one of the heuristics.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's nice.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And then like, yeah, in this power screen, like only the bottom.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Only the bottom one actually works.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Do you have any sort of like visual details or like anything you didn't quite like?

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Regarding like the appearance or the colors used?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The colors are fine.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's good to have like the, what should we call it?

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like all the display settings and stuff.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Damn.

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm surprised you coded those.

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I only did one of mine.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But yeah, so you can change the colors for like accessibility and all that.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's nice.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So overall thoughts?

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's pretty decent.

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Right.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Especially for a prototype, like obviously some things would have to be like kind of

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
polished, but like that's sort of not what you're looking for, is it?

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's just, it does everything you need to.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The only thing that it's obviously missing is, yeah, just like an easy way to add like

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
flatmates and stuff in, but that's more of a like setup type of thing than a day to day

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
thing.

234
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Like we're kind of assuming this is already, you've been using it for a while, right?

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That makes sense.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes.

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But you've got the setting there, so it's not like it's hard to find or anything.

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That makes it nice.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know.

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you for that.

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you for giving us your time and to test our prototype.

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Thanks.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thanks for joining us and hope you have a nice day.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yeah.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Not like you won't be getting big in five minutes time.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Doing the exact same thing.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's exactly ten minutes.
