0	2840	All right, so you have the app in front of you now.
2840	8240	Your first task will be to add a new recurring expense
8240	11880	and split it among household members.
11880	15280	So please begin.
15280	19480	Once you get to the point, the expense in question
19480	21000	is a rent expense.
21000	25320	Let's say it's about $1,200.
25320	28360	The date is maybe the 31st of March.
28360	30360	And let's say you want to repeat it weekly.
33600	37400	And select the three household members that it applies to.
45660	47400	Just tell me when you feel you're done.
47400	48920	OK, I'm done.
48920	50120	Should I click Create?
50120	50620	Yes.
55960	57880	Can you just voice what's happening now?
57880	62160	OK, I can't seem to click on the Create button
62160	65720	to go to the next page, I guess.
65720	68560	Could you put something in the description for me?
68560	69200	Can I type it?
69200	70120	I don't think you can.
70120	71640	OK, that's broken.
71640	72280	Take my breaks.
72280	72800	Interesting.
72800	74320	OK, I'm scrolling out.
74320	75320	Cancel out of here.
75320	75820	OK.
81640	83760	Do you want to just quickly try and do that again?
83760	84260	Sure.
84260	84760	Please can.
84760	87720	Let's see if it doesn't break.
87720	91240	Name, category, let's go rent.
91240	99080	$1,200, 31st of March, weekly, three household members.
99080	100960	Maybe just try and put a description in there.
100960	101960	Oh, OK.
101960	103880	I think I was waiting for the description.
103880	105040	OK, and just press Create.
108120	115360	And interesting, it reset the rent and amount and repeat.
115360	116480	No, it is not.
116720	118880	Do you want to just add Sam again?
118880	119560	Oh, never mind.
119560	120640	It's not even reset them.
120640	122600	It's jumped to cheese.
122600	125200	Oh, I think it's because you made a new expense.
127760	131400	All right, we're going to cancel the,
131400	134160	yeah, we can stop the screen recording there, I think.
134160	134760	That's fine.
134760	136120	Just continue with the next task.
136120	137680	Yeah, no, for the other task.
137680	140440	All right, we'll continue with the next task,
140440	143080	which is to pay an existing expense
143080	145280	and then confirm that it's been removed.
145280	150000	So the expense in question is an expense that Alex has paid
150000	154480	and that you need to now pay him for, them, them for.
154480	159680	That was the power expense, about $80 or so, probably.
159680	161160	Can you verify that that exists?
161160	163640	Oh, food?
163640	165560	Yeah.
165560	168000	Food is $80.
168000	169480	Rent is that much.
169480	171000	Do you want to try expanding?
171000	171500	Yes.
176640	177520	Yes, there we go.
177520	178160	$80.
178160	178640	Perfect.
178640	179640	Can you pay that for me?
190880	192720	Can you confirm, has it been paid?
192720	195360	Should I go back to the home page?
195360	196640	If you'd like to.
196640	199080	Because I'm not sure what's going on.
199080	199580	Fair enough.
202000	205880	I still have the power?
205880	206960	OK, no worries.
206960	207640	That's all right.
207640	208160	That's fine.
208160	209560	We'll continue with the next task.
213000	214360	Right, yes, that's right.
214360	216040	Talk more about what's going on.
216040	218480	Yes, feel free to voice what's happening, your confusions,
218480	222560	your concerns, what's happening in general, what you tried to do,
222560	225840	what happened instead, that kind of thing.
225840	228720	So in this case, you.
228720	230360	Well, I tried to pay the power.
230640	234320	And it disappeared from the pay section.
234320	236240	Well, it's still here.
236240	239120	But when you went to the home page, it was still there.
239120	241720	I'm not 100% sure whether it did pay.
241720	244240	Could you jump over to the pay section and check for me?
244240	245280	Yes.
245280	248000	Is it there still?
248000	249000	It's the first one, yeah.
254160	257200	All right, good to know.
257200	259240	Should I click the pay button again?
259280	260800	No, let's move on to the next task.
260800	262480	OK, I'll go back to home now.
262480	263680	Sounds good.
263680	270080	All right, next up, I'd like you to look at a past expense.
270080	273240	Let's say garbage from last week.
273240	277160	And can you just tell me who paid that garbage expense
277160	278840	last week?
278840	280720	First, should I go to expense tab?
280720	282760	You say you want to go to the expense tab, OK.
282760	284080	And then what do you want to do?
284080	284720	The past week.
284720	285720	Is that what you said?
285720	286480	Yes, last week.
286480	287800	Last week.
287800	295520	So garbage was 380, flatmate person one and person two.
295520	296160	Awesome.
296160	297000	Thank you very much.
297000	298760	So flatmate person one and person two.
304560	308280	All right, thank you very much.
308280	312680	The next task is to, I'd like you
312680	319200	to look at the insights for rent over the past month or so,
319200	323160	or just look at the monthly insights for rent.
323160	325240	And just tell me what you think of it.
325240	326200	What do you see?
326200	329840	Well, I see a pie chart, which clearly describes rent
329840	338920	being 70% of my expenses, and it totaling to $1,800 monthly.
343520	345160	OK, good to know.
349120	352280	Can we move on to task five?
352280	355440	Sorry, do we want to have her correct or not?
355440	357280	OK.
357280	358760	Do we want to move on to task five?
358760	363960	Task five is, I'd like you to enable,
363960	367200	I'd like you to adjust the color scheme of the app,
367200	370920	and maybe the contrast too, if you'd like.
370920	372360	And just sort of talk about what
372360	374640	you're doing as you're doing that, what the outcome is.
374640	376800	Let's go back.
376800	383240	OK, I went to the, when I go to the, oh, what's up here?
383240	386160	Clicked on the navigation three bars.
386160	389280	Went to app settings, display settings,
389280	391920	and assume I can go to the dark mode.
391920	393440	Oh, shit, that's pretty cool.
393440	395920	OK.
395920	398000	And high contrast, oh, wow.
401920	403160	That's pretty cool.
403160	404320	What does system mean?
404320	405080	Is it just like?
407680	409440	OK, good to know.
409440	413560	Typically, the system, the app, the mobile device
413560	415240	is either set to dock or level, so we
415240	417080	can try and learn from that.
417080	421320	So then shouldn't that be the default one?
421320	423400	That's some very useful feedback, thank you.
423400	425800	All right, but can you just change some settings
425800	429080	and tell me what you changed and what you think of it?
431200	433240	Contact and support.
433240	434440	I can.
434440	436160	Sorry, I meant accessibility settings.
436160	437000	Oh, accessibility.
437000	437480	Yes.
441320	443040	That you changed.
443040	445280	Oh, the color themes.
445280	446520	Just need to read.
446520	447680	Yes.
447680	452040	Well, I changed to dark mode and to high contrast.
452040	454120	All right, and do those work well?
454120	455960	Yes, those work well.
455960	458840	Visibly changed across the page.
461680	463000	Awesome.
463000	464920	We'll move on to the next task now,
464920	469400	which is I'd like you to get some help from the app.
469400	474760	I'd like you to go and see the FAQ section, perhaps,
474760	479160	and have a look at some of the frequently asked questions.
479160	479680	OK.
479680	481520	I'm on the frequently asked questions,
481520	484640	and I can click on the questions available
484640	487280	and quickly read through them.
487280	488840	OK.
488840	490440	Well, the first one anyways.
490480	490960	Awesome.
490960	491640	Let's continue.
491640	495280	Let's I'd like you to click on the call.
495280	497160	I'd like you to find contact support
497160	500440	and fill out a support form for me.
500440	502280	Tapped out the first.
502280	507000	I think I've already, hmm, one second.
507000	513400	I can't seem to click on, let me just, like that.
513400	515240	Could I just get you to speak up a little bit
515240	517800	from the microphone, especially since there's background noise?
517800	518400	Yes.
519280	521360	I just changed my whole set up to light mode,
521360	523320	just to see if I can, yep.
523320	525760	So basically, when I was on the dark mode on high contrast,
525760	527120	I couldn't see the name.
527120	527720	OK.
527720	529160	All right, thank you very much.
529160	531880	And now I just click the name, click the email.
531880	534360	OK, could you submit a contact support form for me?
534360	536520	Yeah, I'm just going to click on the message.
536520	538880	I don't know if that types up.
538880	540680	OK, it's sent through.
540680	542920	Could you just confirm that it's been sent through?
542920	545360	Yeah, you just need to smack it a few times.
545360	546840	OK, there you go.
546840	547840	Take my issues.
547840	548840	Yeah.
548840	549840	Sent.
549840	550840	Oh, message sent.
550840	551840	Perfect.
551840	552840	Thank you very much.
552840	553840	And it also has a clear message saying
553840	557200	that I will be able to, like, feed back to you after 24,
557200	558200	48 hours.
558200	559200	Awesome.
559200	560200	Thank you very much.
560200	562720	I believe that is all of the questions, of the tasks.
562720	565240	I will now turn off the recording.
565240	566240	OK.
566240	567240	Thank you very much.
567240	568240	Thank you.
568240	569240	Thank you.

577240	578240	Thank you.
578240	579240	Thank you.
579240	580240	Thank you.
580240	581240	Thank you.
581240	582240	Thank you.
582240	582740	Thank you.
