0	1000	We're all ready?
1000	1500	Yep.
1500	2000	Easy.
2000	2500	You guys are all good?
2500	3000	Yep.
3000	3500	Sweet as.
3500	5000	You have more to learn, by the way.
5000	5500	OK, yeah.
5500	8000	So just wondering, what were your first impressions
8000	10000	using the app?
10000	12000	I thought it was really intuitive.
12000	14000	It wasn't hard to find the different screens
14000	17000	that we need to navigate to or do the different ones.
17000	20500	I really like the icons that are at the bottom,
20500	22500	even across the entire page as well,
22500	25000	telling you what each thing does.
25000	28000	So it's pretty like, even if you don't read it, it's fine.
28000	29500	You can still understand what's going on.
29500	31000	OK, sweet.
31000	34000	I think the only really big issue I had with this
34000	36500	was the bottom part, the colors used.
36500	40000	I think that the green at the bottom is a bit too dark,
40000	42000	because it doesn't contrast that well with the black.
42000	44000	So it can be a little hard to read the text,
44000	46000	especially if you didn't have good vision.
46000	46500	I see.
46500	48500	So the bottom part kind of had an issue,
48500	50000	in terms of contrast being a thing.
50000	50500	Yeah.
50500	52000	If there was a bit of a lighter color,
52000	53500	or if it was white on the color instead,
53500	55000	I think it would have worked better.
55000	55500	OK.
55500	58000	Yeah, I guess in that sense, as you mentioned,
58000	60000	now the icons I feel like are fine for me.
60000	63000	It's just like the text at the bottom kind of got blended.
63000	64500	For me, I'm just looking at it right now,
64500	66000	because when I did do the testing,
66000	67500	I didn't even look at the work.
67500	72500	But now I'm looking at it, the text blends in.
72500	75000	So yeah, probably like a lighter bit at the bottom.
75000	76000	OK, a lighter color.
76000	78500	It kind of gives you a good vibe on how to navigate.
78500	79000	Yeah.
79000	81500	That kind of leads quite nicely into our next question,
81500	84000	which is kind of describe your experience kind of navigating
84000	85500	about these tasks.
85500	88000	Like what are kind of some difficulties you had,
88000	90000	all that sort of benefits?
90000	92000	One issue that I heard, I'm actually
92000	94000	trying to remember what the task was.
94000	98000	OK, we had to go to this one, and then help and support.
98000	100000	Oh yeah, the help and support button doesn't work.
100000	101000	Yeah, I heard that issue.
101000	102500	OK, so in the menu, help and support
102500	104000	doesn't direct you to anything?
104000	104500	Yeah.
104500	105000	Yeah.
105000	106000	OK.
106000	107500	But everything else is fine.
107500	109500	I guess for me, since I didn't actually
109500	111000	even click on the help and support,
111000	113500	because I went to contact support immediately.
113500	115000	So it worked fine for me.
115000	118500	But yeah, I guess if we could link back
118500	122000	to this particular page here, it would make more sense
122000	127500	for a user just having more freedom into the app as well.
127500	128000	OK.
128000	130000	Oh, another thing within the app as well,
130000	134500	when it went to dark mode and high contrast,
134500	136500	you can't see the text.
136500	137500	Yes, yes, yes.
137500	139500	Yeah, like Cassie disappears.
139500	142500	So you don't know whether it's been typed out.
142500	144500	Yeah, that's a good bug.
144500	147000	Yeah, so that's one of the minor issues
147000	150000	that can be fixed immediately.
150000	152500	And also, I forgot to mention this within testing,
152500	155000	but it doesn't stay to the thing.
155000	157500	So you don't know whether that's right.
157500	159500	You can kind of, if you read it, you know.
159500	163500	But if you think about it, like, oh, is that what it is?
163500	164500	Sounds good.
164500	166000	What about other kind of tasks?
166000	167500	Did you have any trouble navigating things
167500	169000	besides settings?
169000	170500	Yes.
170500	173000	I know there's a whole button up here to go back.
173000	176500	But I was looking at buttons down.
176500	178000	For me, when I use my apps, I normally
178000	179500	have buttons down here.
179500	182500	I guess it's mainly the user on the other apps as well.
182500	183500	I use TikTok a lot.
183500	184500	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
184500	188500	It has all the, yeah, so I was kind of like, oh, OK.
188500	191500	OK, cool.
191500	196500	And also, it doesn't really have a home button.
196500	199500	It goes to user.
199500	202500	You can go back, but I don't know what happened here.
203000	204000	Yeah, right.
204000	205000	OK, cool.
205000	207000	And no other tasks?
207000	209500	Yeah, what are the things you liked about the navigation
209500	212500	that you would say would be kept?
212500	215500	I think the way that information is laid out
215500	219000	is quite good, especially on the payments.
219000	221500	I like that it's separate to today, past week, et cetera.
221500	223000	So it's not just one big block of text,
223000	224500	because it can be quite overwhelming.
224500	226000	People don't look through all that.
226000	228000	So I think the information is separate as well.
228000	231500	I like how there's also, for that information,
232000	233500	if you press down, it comes up here.
233500	236500	And for a quick, extra information for a user,
236500	238000	it would be like, OK, I paid this person.
238000	239000	Perfect.
239000	240500	And I'll go into another tab.
240500	242000	Yeah, easy.
242000	243000	So yeah.
243000	245000	I also liked how it was similar to past and future
245000	247000	at the top, more than other expenses.
247000	248000	Yeah.
248000	248500	Yeah.
248500	250000	Cool.
250000	252500	I appreciate that.
252500	255000	They're all on Discord.
255000	257000	Yeah, sorry about that.
257000	259500	OK, and a bit of a quicker question.
259500	263500	How do you feel about the color scheme?
263500	265500	No, I wouldn't choose it.
265500	267000	OK.
267000	271000	I think that the shades of green don't match well.
271000	273500	I like the darker greens, but I think
273500	276500	that the lighter green is a different hue,
276500	277500	if that makes sense.
277500	280000	So I think it's too lime.
280000	282000	It doesn't have enough blue in it.
282000	285500	So I would say I like the colors of this.
285500	288500	It's just the top and the bottom half of it,
288500	291500	which kind of doesn't go well with the app.
291500	292500	I would say that's fine.
292500	293000	OK, cool.
293000	295000	So if you were to change that, what would you guys
295000	296000	feel kind of matched?
296000	297500	I would take out the blue.
297500	300500	I would take out the navy blue, and I'd make it white.
300500	302000	I don't think any other color.
302000	304000	Something like white for the border on,
304000	306500	kind of like showing you, hey, you can add more things here.
306500	307000	OK.
307000	309500	Or maybe like having this lighter shades of green
309500	310500	or something similar to that.
310500	312500	Or I would make this white.
312500	314500	The dash would almost take white to contrast it.
314500	315500	Or white.
315500	318500	In fact, swapping the contrast colors, say, with orange,
318500	321500	would you say would be a better option?
321500	325500	Or maybe something more similar.
325500	327000	I would say that you come with the orange,
327000	329500	but I would say it would not go well with this.
329500	332500	I think contrast, well, it just wouldn't look that.
332500	334000	When it comes to color schemes, I
334000	336500	think it's better to be simpler rather than more complex.
336500	339500	So utilizing white and black and contrast
339500	341500	more and using the same two colors
341500	343500	rather than having lots of different shades
343500	344500	of the same color.
345000	349500	I would say having one bright color within the app
349500	352000	for buttons or maybe for something like these
352000	354000	to show, OK, we have color.
354000	357500	But having the two main, maybe black and white or black
357500	360500	and some other color that is focused on the app as well
360500	363500	could represent you as a company and the app as well.
363500	364000	Cool.
364000	365000	Appreciate it.
365000	365500	OK.
365500	367500	And final question.
367500	369000	If it's where we are, would you use it?
369000	370000	Why or why not?
370000	371500	What would be some good things and what
371500	374000	would be some drawbacks using it?
374000	376000	I actually have a really similar app to this
376000	378000	that I use with my flatmates.
378000	380000	And I think that this has more functionality
380000	382500	for doing different things because it tracks your upcoming
382500	384000	payments, which would be useful.
384000	386500	But the app that I use is definitely a lot simpler,
386500	389000	just because it focuses really on those really simple
389000	392500	add an expense and pay it with your flatmates.
392500	394000	So I'd probably stick with that just
394000	395500	because that's all that I need it for.
395500	397000	But if I wanted an app that could
397000	399000	track my expenses and my budget and stuff,
399000	401500	then I think this would be useful.
401500	402000	I would use it.
402000	403500	It kind of reminds me a little bit.
409500	412500	So any significant drawbacks to the experience using the app?
412500	415000	What does it show?
415000	417500	For me, not really.
417500	419500	Nothing in particular.
419500	422000	There were the minor issues that we had.
422000	425000	But other than that, it's pretty good app.
425000	425500	Thank you.
425500	426000	Cool.
426000	426500	Yeah.
426500	427500	I think that's pretty much it.
427500	429000	Rashid, Amish, nothing else?
429000	429500	No.
429500	430000	Cool.
430000	431000	Thank you for your time.
431000	431500	Thank you.
431500	432500	No worries.
432500	433000	Cool.
433000	435000	So what are all your names?
435000	435500	Rachel.
435500	436000	Rachel.
436000	437000	Arianna.
437000	438500	Karen.
438500	439000	Cool.
439000	440500	Yeah.
