WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
And yeah, just one

00:08.440 --> 00:10.440
Do you want me to like

00:13.980 --> 00:16.100
You'll get a roar and filtered bullets

00:21.160 --> 00:26.720
Good okay, you gotta test our abs to see if you understand the tusks, okay?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Okay

00:33.840 --> 00:39.120
Of adding a new recruit expense and splitting it amongst the household members

00:39.160 --> 00:45.820
So add a new expense and then split it. Yep. Okay, so we'll go to the ad expense button. That's in the bottom

00:46.120 --> 00:48.120
Yeah, and it will come up

00:48.680 --> 00:52.880
Enter the name. Is this the name for the expense? Yep

00:53.880 --> 00:55.880
Is there cheese great?

00:56.960 --> 00:58.960
Try to follow the details rent

00:59.800 --> 01:01.800
Mm-hmm 1200

01:02.440 --> 01:04.620
The baby is 31st of May

01:05.680 --> 01:07.680
repeat weekly

01:10.200 --> 01:12.200
31st of May

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
It's coming up as different values

01:16.720 --> 01:20.600
Try to click again, it's not interactable

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
Oh

01:37.200 --> 01:39.640
Yeah, it's coming up with cheese and then hello and in

01:42.160 --> 01:44.160
Just keep going yeah repeat

01:44.640 --> 01:50.960
Did you want to weekly repeat sweet and then split with everybody wasn't it? Oh three three. Yeah, sweet

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
So all of them

01:53.160 --> 01:56.520
And then create the expense using the button down here

01:57.520 --> 02:02.320
Okay, it's coming up is there wasn't anything there it's a good era

02:03.280 --> 02:04.800
Letting me know

02:04.800 --> 02:06.800
So we wanted it for rent

02:07.720 --> 02:09.720
the immense

02:10.840 --> 02:15.580
1200 okay, it's coming up as 10 and in the repeat was weekly

02:20.400 --> 02:25.240
And we want it to be with Sam as well because we want it to be split with three people, let's see what happens

02:26.520 --> 02:28.160
a

02:28.160 --> 02:30.280
Very funky blue cheese so flat true

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
Okay, I'm assuming that the name

02:44.560 --> 02:50.560
Okay, try well maybe I can exit out and yeah, let's try again let's go at expense

02:51.880 --> 02:53.880
We're entering the name

02:54.600 --> 02:56.600
Cheese still

03:01.560 --> 03:08.060
Yeah, and we go ran into the amount is there it's coming up as hello

03:08.060 --> 03:10.060
Oh

03:11.180 --> 03:12.780
Sure

03:12.780 --> 03:14.780
weekly

03:17.900 --> 03:19.300
Description

03:19.300 --> 03:24.420
Let's try and create it. Okay, it's coming up with an error here. Let's try again

03:25.780 --> 03:31.180
Rinse inter amount is 10 select values weekly

03:38.860 --> 03:40.860
Okay

03:41.460 --> 03:43.460
Creating itself

03:43.820 --> 03:47.020
Don't quite know what's up with that. Okay. Okay, we move in next

03:50.740 --> 03:53.820
It just wouldn't create an expense it would when

03:54.780 --> 03:57.060
the first values were entered

03:57.780 --> 04:02.780
It would then give error messages saying some of the values were blank

04:03.380 --> 04:08.020
Even though they were filled out and then on filling them out again

04:08.780 --> 04:12.340
Clicking the create expense button would just not do something. I wouldn't do anything

04:14.460 --> 04:16.460
Okay, we move to the second task

04:17.300 --> 04:22.460
The second test is to ensure the functionality of payment and existing expense

04:23.220 --> 04:31.060
And verify it removed from the list. Okay, so we're paying an expense. I want to go into the pay up section

04:31.500 --> 04:36.540
And I will guess pay the click the pay button, okay

04:38.580 --> 04:39.900
Open

04:39.900 --> 04:47.080
Alex and you select the power the power cool. Yeah, I'm here. I see the Alex categories

04:47.080 --> 04:51.640
I see the power I will click pay their pay for power. Yes

04:52.300 --> 04:57.300
It is now disappeared from the list and I imagine if I go to home. Yeah

04:57.580 --> 04:59.580
Okay

04:59.580 --> 05:07.040
Okay, the next task is to confirm the ability to view past expense and verify payment history, okay payment

05:07.040 --> 05:12.740
So there's an expenses tab. This is going into yeah, I can see the history from today

05:13.300 --> 05:17.620
The past week and the past month. Okay. Yeah, so you had to locate

05:18.420 --> 05:25.220
Garbage garbage and verify the detail who paid the coverage for that. Okay, so garbage was paid in the past week

05:26.060 --> 05:31.460
$380, you know, it was paid by person one and person two on the 27th of May. Okay, sweet

05:33.220 --> 05:35.220
The next task is to

05:35.220 --> 05:40.500
Verify the inside features for the rent category and ensure equity data visualization

05:40.620 --> 05:46.060
Okay, so we'll go into the insights tab. I can see a very nice pie chart here. Yeah

05:46.580 --> 05:53.260
We've got the top categories for rent, which is indeed the top category power is next. Yeah, then it should be broadband

05:53.260 --> 05:57.460
Yep, and food and other. Yeah. Yeah, so I want you to

05:58.140 --> 06:05.140
Click the event category. The rent category is being clicked. I now have a bar chart with the week. Okay

06:05.820 --> 06:11.880
So you had to view the monthly the monthly I now have the bar chart with four values on it

06:11.880 --> 06:19.500
It was paid consistently it seems with consistent rent. So they're all the same value. Yep, all 450. Yep. Looks good

06:19.540 --> 06:24.500
Okay, your next step is to test the customization option for display and accessibility

06:25.300 --> 06:26.740
ensure

06:26.740 --> 06:33.560
Usability for all users. Okay, so that will probably be in the three bar menu. I'm thinking we're going in here

06:34.080 --> 06:36.080
probably app settings

06:36.780 --> 06:38.780
And we wanted to do

06:38.800 --> 06:39.860
accessibility

06:39.860 --> 06:44.160
Which isn't quite here, but it's probably on the display. Yes

06:45.160 --> 06:50.960
And then there's dark mode system and different contrasts so we wanted accessibility

06:50.960 --> 06:56.560
So let's say we go colorblind friendly. It does indeed change the colors

06:57.640 --> 06:59.140
Okay

06:59.140 --> 07:02.400
Yeah, and it stays as you go through that. Yep. I

07:03.380 --> 07:05.380
Want you to try other?

07:05.640 --> 07:08.900
Accessibility see what you see. Okay, let's go back into

07:09.820 --> 07:17.420
Display so there's the dark mode. Yeah, that works nicely. We've got high contrast which does that as well?

07:18.460 --> 07:20.460
The system do something. I

07:21.200 --> 07:23.200
imagine

07:27.380 --> 07:29.260
All works well

07:29.260 --> 07:32.900
Okay, your last time is to help test the help and support spontaneity

07:33.500 --> 07:38.860
Open support ensuring user can find information and contact support if needed perfect

07:38.900 --> 07:45.940
That will again probably be in the three bar menu help and supports right there. Good. It's not showing as interactable

07:50.860 --> 07:56.660
Try app setting app settings if we go into absent. Yep. Okay. There is a helping sport thing in app settings

07:57.020 --> 07:59.900
That could be one thing to just have as a little issue

08:00.540 --> 08:02.540
It's in two different places

08:03.140 --> 08:05.140
So we'd want to contact support

08:05.620 --> 08:07.620
Yeah, and then we'd want to fill out our information

08:08.220 --> 08:13.780
Our email the message that we have and then we could send it and it comes up with the confirmation

08:21.020 --> 08:27.700
No, it was all very intuitive yeah, no, it was easy to move around the buttons made sense

08:28.460 --> 08:32.060
There was good contrast with the interactable areas

08:32.060 --> 08:34.060
I

08:34.620 --> 08:38.620
Didn't have to second-guess myself on anything it all made sense to use

08:40.460 --> 08:45.500
The only thing that kind of went wrong was just a figma issue which the figma was better

08:45.500 --> 08:49.460
I imagine it wouldn't have gone wrong in the first place and it would have worked as it was intended

08:50.020 --> 08:52.920
So I didn't really have any negative feedback to give

08:53.620 --> 08:55.620
Okay, what about us one any?

08:57.340 --> 08:59.940
Yeah expense one the expense stuff made sense

09:00.940 --> 09:07.140
But I had coated you know, yeah, that's just the figma thing it'll kind of make sense to use

09:09.540 --> 09:13.460
Good functionalities in there you had your history with all the information

09:14.180 --> 09:17.780
Yeah, I like the bear with the variety you guys have in there

09:17.780 --> 09:21.740
I think the the traversal options you have is good. I like the tabs

09:21.820 --> 09:25.300
Did I see that it was part of it was swipeable and some like that

09:25.300 --> 09:29.660
Yeah, so you've got some swipe functionality which I think is really cool

09:31.780 --> 09:36.020
That like yet you've got good headers you've got all that it's all in there

09:37.220 --> 09:40.020
Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you
