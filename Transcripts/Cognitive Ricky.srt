1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
And yeah, just one

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,440
Do you want me to like

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,100
You'll get a roar and filtered bullets

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,720
Good okay, you gotta test our abs to see if you understand the tusks, okay?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,120
Of adding a new recruit expense and splitting it amongst the household members

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,820
So add a new expense and then split it. Yep. Okay, so we'll go to the ad expense button. That's in the bottom

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Yeah, and it will come up

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,880
Enter the name. Is this the name for the expense? Yep

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Is there cheese great?

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Try to follow the details rent

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Mm-hmm 1200

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,620
The baby is 31st of May

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
repeat weekly

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
31st of May

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
It's coming up as different values

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,600
Try to click again, it's not interactable

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Oh

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, it's coming up with cheese and then hello and in

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Just keep going yeah repeat

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,960
Did you want to weekly repeat sweet and then split with everybody wasn't it? Oh three three. Yeah, sweet

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
So all of them

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,520
And then create the expense using the button down here

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
Okay, it's coming up is there wasn't anything there it's a good era

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,800
Letting me know

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
So we wanted it for rent

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
the immense

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,580
1200 okay, it's coming up as 10 and in the repeat was weekly

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,240
And we want it to be with Sam as well because we want it to be split with three people, let's see what happens

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,160
a

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,280
Very funky blue cheese so flat true

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Okay, I'm assuming that the name

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Okay, try well maybe I can exit out and yeah, let's try again let's go at expense

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
We're entering the name

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Cheese still

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,060
Yeah, and we go ran into the amount is there it's coming up as hello

37
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
Oh

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,780
Sure

39
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
weekly

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,300
Description

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,420
Let's try and create it. Okay, it's coming up with an error here. Let's try again

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Rinse inter amount is 10 select values weekly

43
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Okay

44
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Creating itself

45
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,020
Don't quite know what's up with that. Okay. Okay, we move in next

46
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,820
It just wouldn't create an expense it would when

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,060
the first values were entered

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,780
It would then give error messages saying some of the values were blank

49
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,020
Even though they were filled out and then on filling them out again

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,340
Clicking the create expense button would just not do something. I wouldn't do anything

51
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Okay, we move to the second task

52
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,460
The second test is to ensure the functionality of payment and existing expense

53
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,060
And verify it removed from the list. Okay, so we're paying an expense. I want to go into the pay up section

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,540
And I will guess pay the click the pay button, okay

55
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,900
Open

56
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,080
Alex and you select the power the power cool. Yeah, I'm here. I see the Alex categories

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,640
I see the power I will click pay their pay for power. Yes

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
It is now disappeared from the list and I imagine if I go to home. Yeah

59
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
Okay

60
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:07,040
Okay, the next task is to confirm the ability to view past expense and verify payment history, okay payment

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,740
So there's an expenses tab. This is going into yeah, I can see the history from today

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,620
The past week and the past month. Okay. Yeah, so you had to locate

63
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:25,220
Garbage garbage and verify the detail who paid the coverage for that. Okay, so garbage was paid in the past week

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,460
$380, you know, it was paid by person one and person two on the 27th of May. Okay, sweet

65
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
The next task is to

66
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,500
Verify the inside features for the rent category and ensure equity data visualization

67
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,060
Okay, so we'll go into the insights tab. I can see a very nice pie chart here. Yeah

68
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,260
We've got the top categories for rent, which is indeed the top category power is next. Yeah, then it should be broadband

69
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,460
Yep, and food and other. Yeah. Yeah, so I want you to

70
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Click the event category. The rent category is being clicked. I now have a bar chart with the week. Okay

71
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,880
So you had to view the monthly the monthly I now have the bar chart with four values on it

72
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,500
It was paid consistently it seems with consistent rent. So they're all the same value. Yep, all 450. Yep. Looks good

73
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,500
Okay, your next step is to test the customization option for display and accessibility

74
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,740
ensure

75
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:33,560
Usability for all users. Okay, so that will probably be in the three bar menu. I'm thinking we're going in here

76
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
probably app settings

77
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
And we wanted to do

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,860
accessibility

79
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,160
Which isn't quite here, but it's probably on the display. Yes

80
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,960
And then there's dark mode system and different contrasts so we wanted accessibility

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,560
So let's say we go colorblind friendly. It does indeed change the colors

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,140
Okay

83
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah, and it stays as you go through that. Yep. I

84
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Want you to try other?

85
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,900
Accessibility see what you see. Okay, let's go back into

86
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:17,420
Display so there's the dark mode. Yeah, that works nicely. We've got high contrast which does that as well?

87
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
The system do something. I

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
imagine

89
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,260
All works well

90
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,900
Okay, your last time is to help test the help and support spontaneity

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,860
Open support ensuring user can find information and contact support if needed perfect

92
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,940
That will again probably be in the three bar menu help and supports right there. Good. It's not showing as interactable

93
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,660
Try app setting app settings if we go into absent. Yep. Okay. There is a helping sport thing in app settings

94
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,900
That could be one thing to just have as a little issue

95
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
It's in two different places

96
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
So we'd want to contact support

97
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
Yeah, and then we'd want to fill out our information

98
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,780
Our email the message that we have and then we could send it and it comes up with the confirmation

99
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:27,700
No, it was all very intuitive yeah, no, it was easy to move around the buttons made sense

100
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,060
There was good contrast with the interactable areas

101
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,060
I

102
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Didn't have to second-guess myself on anything it all made sense to use

103
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,500
The only thing that kind of went wrong was just a figma issue which the figma was better

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,460
I imagine it wouldn't have gone wrong in the first place and it would have worked as it was intended

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,920
So I didn't really have any negative feedback to give

106
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Okay, what about us one any?

107
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,940
Yeah expense one the expense stuff made sense

108
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,140
But I had coated you know, yeah, that's just the figma thing it'll kind of make sense to use

109
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,460
Good functionalities in there you had your history with all the information

110
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,780
Yeah, I like the bear with the variety you guys have in there

111
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,740
I think the the traversal options you have is good. I like the tabs

112
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,300
Did I see that it was part of it was swipeable and some like that

113
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,660
Yeah, so you've got some swipe functionality which I think is really cool

114
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,020
That like yet you've got good headers you've got all that it's all in there

115
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,020
Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you
