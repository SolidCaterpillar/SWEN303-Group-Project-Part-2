00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Cool, okay, task one, could you verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense

00:06.200 --> 00:10.920
and splitting it amongst all of the household members?

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
Make sure you speak out loud.

00:11.920 --> 00:16.920
Okay, so, is it add expense button at the bottom right, so I'm just going to go with

00:16.920 --> 00:17.920
that.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.920
I'm just going to add a name, it seems like it's compulsory, so I'm just going to fill

00:20.920 --> 00:22.920
out the rest of the things we're all with.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.920
I can't type it, but it's, does that fill something in for me, which it works, because

00:26.920 --> 00:28.920
I don't want to type anyway.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.840
I'm going to select rent, because it said it was rent, and I'll enter an amount.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.840
I can't enter an amount?

00:34.840 --> 00:36.840
Oh, it gave me an amount, fantastic.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.840
That's really expensive.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.840
I'm glad my rent isn't that much.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.840
Alright, let me add a date.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.840
I think it will add one for me again.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.840
Yep, it did, fantastic.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.840
And I want to make it recurring, so I'm going to select a value, and rent, for that much

00:52.840 --> 00:56.840
rent, you should be paying it every month, so I'm going to go monthly, and I want to

00:56.840 --> 00:58.840
split it equally with all flatmates, right?

00:59.760 --> 01:04.760
So I'll select everybody, me, Alex, and Sam.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.760
I'll add a description, I guess I'll let it add it for me, right for the three of us,

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
love it.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.760
I'll press the create button at the bottom.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.760
I'm just not letting it press it.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Okay.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.760
It's not letting it press it.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.760
Yeah, I believe that might be an issue with the app, so we can just continue from there.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.760
That's all good.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.680
Make note of that.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.680
Cool, okay, task two.

01:32.680 --> 01:38.680
Could you ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense, and verify that it's

01:38.680 --> 01:39.680
removed?

01:39.680 --> 01:40.680
Okay.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.680
So, you're wanting to pay an amount that you're owing to somebody.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.680
Okay.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.680
So, I've got my upcoming, so I don't think I'm talking about that.

01:51.680 --> 01:56.680
I think I'm going to pay someone who I owe money to, so I'll try pay Alex for rent,

01:57.600 --> 02:08.600
not, I'm trying to click on, so I initially tried to click on the user name of the person,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.600
it doesn't work, so I've pressed the pay button instead.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.600
And now I've got all my list of things I need to pay, which is great.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.600
So I'm going to pay rent, and then I'll press the pay button.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.600
It's less than big, which is cool.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.600
I don't know if I should look for it.

02:21.600 --> 02:25.600
Okay, it seems like the app wants me to go with the power one, which is fine.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.520
Oh, it's green.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.520
It's cute.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.520
Pay for power.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
Yes.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
I would love to do that.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
Sweet.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.520
It looks like it's been paid.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.520
Now, I'm just going to see if I can confirm it.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
Or if I can leave the screen.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.520
That would also be fine.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.520
I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.520
Oh, I'm lost to my inside.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
That's fun.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.520
Can I go home from there?

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
No.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.520
Cool.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.520
I'm kind of stuck in this domain, I think.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
Okay, cool.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.520
So you've removed the...

02:54.520 --> 02:55.520
Oh, there I go.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.440
Sweet.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.440
So you removed it, and then you were stuck on what screen?

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
Sorry?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.440
I was stuck on the pay screen, so this screen.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
Right.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.440
Because I think for this, because the colours are kind of darker, I assumed it was blurred

03:08.440 --> 03:11.440
out or in the background, so I didn't realise I could actually still interact with this

03:11.440 --> 03:12.440
screen.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
Okay.

03:13.440 --> 03:14.440
That makes sense.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.440
I think I would have been looking for a back button or something.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
Yeah.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.440
That makes sense.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
Awesome.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
Cool.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
And if you just go back to the dashboard.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Awesome.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
Cool.

03:23.360 --> 03:29.360
I'm going to go back to past expenses from the previous week and find out who paid for

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
one of them.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.360
Okay.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
So I'm thinking about past expenses.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
The first thing I look at is an expenses tab.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
I'm going to go to that.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
I'm looking at the past week.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.360
That probably includes today as well.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
So there's all these three.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.360
Back to expenses?

03:38.360 --> 03:39.360
Yeah.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
Past week, played the garbage.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
Paid for some food.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.360
Paid for some rent.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
Is there anything else?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
No.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
That's all.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
Cool.

03:46.360 --> 04:03.120
And task four is validate the insights feature for the rent category and ensure that you

04:03.120 --> 04:05.040
can see the data for it.

04:05.040 --> 04:10.360
So you're just viewing the rent category insights, specifically for rent.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.360
Okay.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
Oh, insights.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
All right.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.360
So insights being the bottom here.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.360
All right.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.360
And I want to look at the rent category.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.360
So I'm going to click on rent.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.360
See what happens.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
Oh, I see it.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.360
I see today I paid 50.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.360
If I press on monthly, I pay 50 every week.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.360
Which makes a lot of sense.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.360
That's how rent works.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.360
Sweet.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.360
Sweet.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
Awesome.

04:34.360 --> 04:38.360
Task five, test the customization options for the display and accessibility.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
Okay.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
Yeah.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.360
So if I'm thinking about accessibility, I'm always going to go here.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
I see settings.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
That's good.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.360
Display settings.

04:46.360 --> 04:51.360
It probably would be in display settings, I would guess.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
Oh, yeah.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.360
Accessibility.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.360
High contrast and colorblind friendly.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.360
Let me try high contrast.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
Nice.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.360
Dark mode.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.360
I like it.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.360
Colorblind friendly.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
Oh, yeah.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.360
So it's all the same color.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.360
Or it's the same color scheme.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.360
So there's people with color.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
Cool.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
Is there anything else?

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
Cool.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
Just test the light dark mode.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.360
Make sure that works.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.360
Yeah.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
Dark mode seems to work.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
Follow system.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
Cool.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
Easy.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.360
Cool.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.360
And if you just go back to default.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
That's okay.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
Just on the display settings.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
Sorry.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
Higher.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
Yeah.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
That's all good.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.360
Sweet.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.360
Cool.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.360
And just go back to the dashboard.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.360
Perfect.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.360
Cool.

05:32.360 --> 05:37.360
Task six, test the help and support functionality.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.360
So first go to the frequently answered questions and look at that.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.360
And then try and submit a help request.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.360
Okay.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.360
I'm going to go to this menu again.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.360
It's kind of always my default if I think about settings and stuff.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.360
Help and support's right there.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
So I'm going to go there.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.360
I'm not allowed to click on it.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.360
Cool.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
Okay.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.360
If we could continue by just go to app settings.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
Oh, I see.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.360
Okay.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
Help and support.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.360
Okay.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.360
So I want to look at frequently asked questions first.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
The purpose of it.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.360
Just that one.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
That's all good.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.360
And then I want to submit a help request.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
Contact support.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.360
And just input there.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.360
Do an email.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.360
And my deep concern.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.360
And I can send it.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
Nice.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.360
Okay, cool.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
Awesome.

06:29.360 --> 06:33.360
And any general thoughts on any of the tasks?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.360
I thought they were pretty good.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.360
I'm pretty impressed with what you actually put together and the time we were given.

06:39.360 --> 06:44.360
I like the separation of who you have to pay and your upcoming payments.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.360
I do think it's a lot for one app to do.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.360
I think more often apps would work for either one thing or the other.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.360
So I think it could be a little confusing to have so much functionality in one thing.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.360
But if you were an experienced user and you figured out how to use it, it would be awesome.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.360
Cool.

06:58.360 --> 07:03.360
And any big difficulties with any of the tasks?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.360
I don't think so.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.360
I think probably the main thing would just be with the help thing, not being able to

07:06.360 --> 07:07.360
access it there.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.360
But I assume if it was a real prototype, that wouldn't be an issue.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.360
Cool.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
Awesome.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
Sweet.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.360
And that's it for now.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.360
Awesome.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
Thank you so much.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Thank you.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
Hell yeah.

07:18.360 --> 07:18.860
Thank you.
