0	6200	Cool, okay, task one, could you verify the functionality of adding a new recurring expense
6200	10920	and splitting it amongst all of the household members?
10920	11920	Make sure you speak out loud.
11920	16920	Okay, so, is it add expense button at the bottom right, so I'm just going to go with
16920	17920	that.
17920	20920	I'm just going to add a name, it seems like it's compulsory, so I'm just going to fill
20920	22920	out the rest of the things we're all with.
22920	26920	I can't type it, but it's, does that fill something in for me, which it works, because
26920	28920	I don't want to type anyway.
29840	33840	I'm going to select rent, because it said it was rent, and I'll enter an amount.
33840	34840	I can't enter an amount?
34840	36840	Oh, it gave me an amount, fantastic.
36840	37840	That's really expensive.
37840	39840	I'm glad my rent isn't that much.
39840	41840	Alright, let me add a date.
41840	43840	I think it will add one for me again.
43840	45840	Yep, it did, fantastic.
45840	52840	And I want to make it recurring, so I'm going to select a value, and rent, for that much
52840	56840	rent, you should be paying it every month, so I'm going to go monthly, and I want to
56840	58840	split it equally with all flatmates, right?
59760	64760	So I'll select everybody, me, Alex, and Sam.
64760	68760	I'll add a description, I guess I'll let it add it for me, right for the three of us,
68760	69760	love it.
69760	72760	I'll press the create button at the bottom.
72760	75760	I'm just not letting it press it.
75760	76760	Okay.
76760	79760	It's not letting it press it.
79760	85760	Yeah, I believe that might be an issue with the app, so we can just continue from there.
85760	87760	That's all good.
88680	90680	Make note of that.
90680	92680	Cool, okay, task two.
92680	98680	Could you ensure the functionality of paying an existing expense, and verify that it's
98680	99680	removed?
99680	100680	Okay.
100680	105680	So, you're wanting to pay an amount that you're owing to somebody.
105680	106680	Okay.
108680	111680	So, I've got my upcoming, so I don't think I'm talking about that.
111680	116680	I think I'm going to pay someone who I owe money to, so I'll try pay Alex for rent,
117600	128600	not, I'm trying to click on, so I initially tried to click on the user name of the person,
128600	131600	it doesn't work, so I've pressed the pay button instead.
131600	134600	And now I've got all my list of things I need to pay, which is great.
134600	137600	So I'm going to pay rent, and then I'll press the pay button.
137600	139600	It's less than big, which is cool.
139600	141600	I don't know if I should look for it.
141600	145600	Okay, it seems like the app wants me to go with the power one, which is fine.
146520	147520	Oh, it's green.
147520	148520	It's cute.
148520	149520	Pay for power.
149520	150520	Yes.
150520	151520	I would love to do that.
151520	152520	Sweet.
152520	153520	It looks like it's been paid.
153520	158520	Now, I'm just going to see if I can confirm it.
158520	159520	Or if I can leave the screen.
159520	160520	That would also be fine.
160520	162520	I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.
162520	164520	Oh, I'm lost to my inside.
164520	165520	That's fun.
165520	168520	Can I go home from there?
168520	169520	No.
169520	170520	Cool.
170520	172520	I'm kind of stuck in this domain, I think.
172520	173520	Okay, cool.
173520	174520	So you've removed the...
174520	175520	Oh, there I go.
176440	177440	Sweet.
177440	180440	So you removed it, and then you were stuck on what screen?
180440	181440	Sorry?
181440	184440	I was stuck on the pay screen, so this screen.
184440	185440	Right.
185440	188440	Because I think for this, because the colours are kind of darker, I assumed it was blurred
188440	191440	out or in the background, so I didn't realise I could actually still interact with this
191440	192440	screen.
192440	193440	Okay.
193440	194440	That makes sense.
194440	195440	I think I would have been looking for a back button or something.
195440	196440	Yeah.
196440	197440	That makes sense.
197440	198440	Awesome.
198440	199440	Cool.
199440	200440	And if you just go back to the dashboard.
200440	201440	Awesome.
201440	202440	Cool.
203360	209360	I'm going to go back to past expenses from the previous week and find out who paid for
209360	210360	one of them.
210360	211360	Okay.
211360	212360	So I'm thinking about past expenses.
212360	213360	The first thing I look at is an expenses tab.
213360	214360	I'm going to go to that.
214360	215360	I'm looking at the past week.
215360	216360	That probably includes today as well.
216360	217360	So there's all these three.
217360	218360	Back to expenses?
218360	219360	Yeah.
219360	220360	Past week, played the garbage.
220360	221360	Paid for some food.
221360	222360	Paid for some rent.
222360	223360	Is there anything else?
223360	224360	No.
224360	225360	That's all.
225360	226360	Cool.
226360	243120	And task four is validate the insights feature for the rent category and ensure that you
243120	245040	can see the data for it.
245040	250360	So you're just viewing the rent category insights, specifically for rent.
250360	251360	Okay.
252360	253360	Oh, insights.
253360	254360	All right.
254360	255360	So insights being the bottom here.
255360	256360	All right.
256360	257360	And I want to look at the rent category.
257360	258360	So I'm going to click on rent.
258360	259360	See what happens.
259360	260360	Oh, I see it.
260360	264360	I see today I paid 50.
264360	267360	If I press on monthly, I pay 50 every week.
267360	269360	Which makes a lot of sense.
269360	271360	That's how rent works.
271360	272360	Sweet.
272360	273360	Sweet.
273360	274360	Awesome.
274360	278360	Task five, test the customization options for the display and accessibility.
278360	279360	Okay.
279360	280360	Yeah.
280360	283360	So if I'm thinking about accessibility, I'm always going to go here.
283360	284360	I see settings.
284360	285360	That's good.
285360	286360	Display settings.
286360	291360	It probably would be in display settings, I would guess.
291360	292360	Oh, yeah.
292360	293360	Accessibility.
293360	294360	High contrast and colorblind friendly.
294360	295360	Let me try high contrast.
295360	296360	Nice.
296360	297360	Dark mode.
297360	298360	I like it.
298360	299360	Colorblind friendly.
299360	300360	Oh, yeah.
300360	302360	So it's all the same color.
302360	304360	Or it's the same color scheme.
304360	306360	So there's people with color.
306360	307360	Cool.
307360	308360	Is there anything else?
308360	309360	Cool.
309360	310360	Just test the light dark mode.
310360	311360	Make sure that works.
311360	312360	Yeah.
312360	314360	Dark mode seems to work.
314360	315360	Follow system.
315360	316360	Cool.
316360	317360	Easy.
317360	318360	Cool.
318360	319360	And if you just go back to default.
319360	320360	That's okay.
320360	321360	Just on the display settings.
321360	322360	Sorry.
322360	323360	Higher.
323360	324360	Yeah.
324360	325360	That's all good.
325360	326360	Sweet.
326360	327360	Cool.
327360	330360	And just go back to the dashboard.
330360	331360	Perfect.
331360	332360	Cool.
332360	337360	Task six, test the help and support functionality.
337360	341360	So first go to the frequently answered questions and look at that.
341360	344360	And then try and submit a help request.
344360	345360	Okay.
345360	347360	I'm going to go to this menu again.
347360	350360	It's kind of always my default if I think about settings and stuff.
350360	352360	Help and support's right there.
352360	353360	So I'm going to go there.
353360	354360	I'm not allowed to click on it.
354360	355360	Cool.
355360	356360	Okay.
356360	360360	If we could continue by just go to app settings.
360360	361360	Oh, I see.
361360	362360	Okay.
362360	363360	Help and support.
363360	364360	Okay.
365360	369360	So I want to look at frequently asked questions first.
369360	371360	The purpose of it.
371360	372360	Just that one.
372360	373360	That's all good.
373360	376360	And then I want to submit a help request.
376360	378360	Contact support.
378360	380360	And just input there.
380360	381360	Do an email.
381360	385360	And my deep concern.
385360	386360	And I can send it.
386360	387360	Nice.
387360	388360	Okay, cool.
388360	389360	Awesome.
389360	393360	And any general thoughts on any of the tasks?
393360	395360	I thought they were pretty good.
395360	399360	I'm pretty impressed with what you actually put together and the time we were given.
399360	404360	I like the separation of who you have to pay and your upcoming payments.
404360	407360	I do think it's a lot for one app to do.
407360	410360	I think more often apps would work for either one thing or the other.
410360	413360	So I think it could be a little confusing to have so much functionality in one thing.
413360	417360	But if you were an experienced user and you figured out how to use it, it would be awesome.
417360	418360	Cool.
418360	423360	And any big difficulties with any of the tasks?
423360	424360	I don't think so.
424360	426360	I think probably the main thing would just be with the help thing, not being able to
426360	427360	access it there.
427360	430360	But I assume if it was a real prototype, that wouldn't be an issue.
430360	431360	Cool.
431360	432360	Awesome.
432360	433360	Sweet.
433360	434360	And that's it for now.
434360	435360	Awesome.
435360	436360	Thank you so much.
436360	437360	Thank you.
437360	438360	Hell yeah.
438360	438860	Thank you.
